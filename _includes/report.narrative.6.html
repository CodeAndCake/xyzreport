        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Like the prior twin shipwrecks of October 2013, the April shipwrecks caused a public outcry and a policy upheaval. At the debate in the European Parliament on 29 April 2015, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, gave a speech in which he admitted that:</p>

        <div class="quote">
              <div class="quote-text">

          <p class="emphasized-text">
          However, the ending of Mare Nostrum cannot adequately be described as a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo;. It was a clear decision taken by the Italian government, to which EU policymakers and agencies responded in a tragically inadequate way by (non-)replacing it with Frontex&rsquo;s more limited Triton operation. As we have demonstrated in the successive sections of our report, EU policy makers and agencies were not now &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; the terrible reality they had brought fourth inadvertently. Even more so after the tragic events of the Black Week, this policy and its effects must be characterized as an act of killing by omission.
          </p>
        </div>


        <p>We could expect that the conduct of the agency that played a leading role in shaping policy-makers decisions towards what was described as a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; by the Commission&rsquo;s own president, i.e. Frontex, would fall under severe scrutiny and be deeply overhauled. Instead, in the very same speech Juncker announced that Frontex&rsquo;s budget would be trebled.</p>


        <p>At the same time, however, Juncker also announced that Triton&rsquo;s operational zone would be expanded as a way of &ldquo;restoring something that we had lost along the way.&rdquo; This was the first major shift produced by the April shipwrecks. On 13 May 2015, the European Commission declared that &ldquo;search and rescue efforts will be stepped up to restore the level of intervention provided under the former Italian &lsquo;Mare Nostrum&rsquo; operation.&rdquo;

        {% include footnote-block.html content='European Commission, <em>A European Agenda on Migration</em>, COM(2015) 240 final, Brussels, 13 May 2016' %}

        On 26 May, Frontex adopted a new operational plan for Operation Triton, with an increased budget, additional assets and an expanded operational area from 30 up to 138 nautical miles south of Lampedusa, almost reaching the extent that had been covered earlier by MN.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='See Amnesty International, <em>A safer sea: The impact of increased search and rescue operations in the central Mediterranean</em> (EUR 03/2059/2015), 9 July 2015, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur03/2059/2015/en/"">https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur03/2059/2015/en/</a> (last accessed 13 April 2016) for a summary of this institutional process.

        However, contrary to Juncker&rsquo;s and subsequent statements&rsquo; description of Frontex&rsquo;s expansion as &ldquo;restoring&rdquo; the situation prior to the ending of MN, we should note that Triton did not become a European Mare Nostrum. While Frontex&rsquo;s operational zone was expanded further south, it still did not reach the extent Mare Nostrum had. Furthermore, its operational priority continued to be border control as opposed to saving lives, and its assets would thus continue not be deployed proactively towards SAR.</p>


        <p>A second impressive shift bought about by the Black Week has been the dramatic decrease in the rate of mobilisation of commercial ships for the purpose of rescue operations: the number of people rescued by commercial ships went down from 11,954 in the first five months of 2015 to only 3,689 from June to September, thus dropping from a contribution of 30 percent of the total of all rescues to 4 percent (Italian Coast Guard data, see <!--<a href=#>annex</a>-->annex).</p>


        <p>Thirdly, the institutional process that saw the extension of Triton also led to the decision to launch a novel military operation at sea: the European Union military operation in the Southern Central Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR MED). The operation was launched following a statement on 23 April by the EU Council that mentions the EU&rsquo;s commitment to &ldquo;undertake systematic efforts to identify, capture and destroy vessels before they are used by traffickers&rdquo; and to &ldquo;disrupt trafficking networks, bring the perpetrators to justice and seize their assets.&rdquo;

        To this effect, Federica Mogherini, the EU&rsquo;s chief foreign and security policy coordinator, was &ldquo;invited to immediately begin preparations for a possible CSDP (Common Security and Defence Policy) operation.&rdquo;

        In the following weeks, the operation was further defined according to three operational phases, ranging from surveillance activities, interception and destruction of vessels used for smuggling on the high seas, to direct military action against smugglers inside Libyan territorial waters.

        From the formal beginning of EUNAVFOR MED on 22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;June 2015, the operation&rsquo;s command started coordinating the several military vessels that had been deployed by different states in a more or less chaotic manner in the immediate aftermath of the April shipwrecks.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='In its July 2015 statement, &ldquo;A Safer Sea&rdquo;, Amnesty International summarizes this deployment: &ldquo;A number of governments decided to deploy naval and aerial assets outside Operation Triton, in national humanitarian operations to assist refugees and migrants in peril at sea.

It was followed on 7 May by the German Navy ships Berlin and Hessen and later in May by the Irish ship L&eacute; Eithne. Within a few days of reaching the central Mediterranean, they all started assisting refugees and migrants&rdquo;.

While most of these assets (or their replacement) came under EUNAVFOR MED command, a notable exception has been the Irish assets that remained independent within Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pontus&rdquo; operation. This operation retained a clear humanitarian priority, rescuing about 7,000 migrants in the Mediterranean between May and September 2015. &ldquo;Thursday 24th September &ndash; Deployment of L&eacute; Samuel Beckett to Mediterranean&rdquo;, &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, Defence Forces Ireland, 24 September 2015, <a href="http://www.military.ie/ie/an-tseirbhis-chabhlaigh/nuacht-agus-imeachtai/single-view/article/thursday-24th-september-deployment-of-le-samuel-beckett-to-mediterranean/?cHash=3b0ac2113f4cc3f25847862e9bc808ba">http://www.military.ie/ie/an-tseirbhis-chabhlaigh/nuacht-agus-imeachtai/single-view/article/thursday-24th-september-deployment-of-le-samuel-beckett-to-mediterranean/?cHash=3b0ac2113f4cc3f25847862e9bc808ba</a> (last accessed 16 April 2016).' %}

        With at least five planes and four ships, deployed by twenty-two different countries on a rotational basis close to the Libyan cost, EUNAVFOR MED came to reconstitute the naval force that the ending of MN had left vacant.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='Press Release 01/05 &ldquo;EUNAVFOR MED Force Fully Operational&rdquo;, European Union External Action,<a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/csdp/missions-and-operations/eunavfor-med/press-releases/20150728_en.htm">http://eeas.europa.eu/csdp/missions-and-operations/eunavfor-med/press-releases/20150728_en.htm</a> (last accessed 13 April 2016) and &ldquo;European Union Naval Force &ndash; Mediterranean Operation Sophia&rdquo;, European Union External Action, <a href="http://www.eeas.europa.eu/csdp/missions-and-operations/eunavfor-med/pdf/factsheet_eunavfor_med_en.pdf">http://www.eeas.europa.eu/csdp/missions-and-operations/eunavfor-med/pdf/factsheet_eunavfor_med_en.pdf</a> (last accessed 13 April 2016).' %}

        However, just like the Triton operation, at the core of its mission have been security concerns, not humanitarian ones. As such, rather than a &ldquo;humanitarian and military&rdquo; operation similar to MN, at work has been &ldquo;a police operation with military means&rdquo;, as Rear Admiral Herv&eacute; Bl&eacute;jean, the Deputy Operation Commander in the Mediterranean, describes it. &ldquo;The adversaries&rdquo;, he contended, &ldquo;are not combatants but criminals, and the aim is not to eliminate them but to bring them to justice.&rdquo;

        As a consequence, saving the lives of migrants has been far from the mission&rsquo;s operational priority. This was clearly illustrated when it was revealed that the UK&rsquo;s <em>HMS Entreprise</em> had not rescued a single migrant after almost eight weeks of deployment on intelligence-gathering missions near the Libyan coast.

        While it appears that after the summer more rescue operations were conducted, and by the end of 2015 (after six months of activity) 8,500 people had been rescued by assets operating within EUNAVFOR MED;

        this number pales in relation to the rescue operated by M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) for example, which in eight months of activity rescued 20,129 people.

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The fourth and last major shift that followed the April shipwrecks is connected precisely to the intervention of independent NGOs in the Mediterranean. While the operational priority of providing assistance to migrants at sea was stripped of the mission of state-led operations Triton and EUNAVFOR MED, non-governmental humanitarian actors took the initiative to launch a series of rescue operations, constituting a veritable civilian rescue flotilla.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='Maurice Stierl, &ldquo;Maritime Humanitarians, Migrant Suffering and the Idea of Europe&rdquo;, <em>Antipode</em> (forthcoming).' %}

        In early April 2015, MSF (Holland) had already announced that it would join the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS, in operation since 2014) to provide medical assistance on board the <em>Phoenix</em>.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, &ldquo;MSF &amp; MOAS to launch Mediterranean search, rescue and medical aid operation&rdquo;, 10 April 2015,<a href="http://www.msf.org/article/msf-moas-launch-mediterranean-search-rescue-and-medical-aid-operation">http://www.msf.org/article/msf-moas-launch-mediterranean-search-rescue-and-medical-aid-operation</a> (last accessed 14 April 2016).' %}

        In the aftermath of April 18, MSF launched two further rescue missions of its own on board the boats <em>Bourbon Argos</em> (MSF Belgium) and <em>Dignity I </em>(MSF Spain).

        {% include footnote-block.html content='M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, &ldquo;Mediterranean Migration&rdquo;, last updated 21 March 2016,<a href="http://www.msf.org/topics/mediterranean-migration">http://www.msf.org/topics/mediterranean-migration</a> (last accessed 14 April 2016).' %}

        In May 2015, Seawatch, an independent first-aid and rescue operation initiated by a group of German citizens, sailed to the central Mediterranean. Finally, an additional initiative of this kind called SOS Mediterran&eacute;e has recently been launched.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='See <a href="http://sea-watch.org/en/">http://sea-watch.org/en/</a> and <a href="http://sosmediterranee.org/">http://sosmediterranee.org/</a>.

        The main patrolling and rescuing zone of the vessels constituting this civilian flotilla has been immediately outside the Libyan territorial waters, between Tripoli and Zuwara &ndash; an area that had been covered by MN. While the civilian rescue activities have remained trapped in the &ldquo;half-way bridge&rdquo; conundrum that had already proven its limits in the frame of the MN operation &ndash; as their intervention could not prevent migrants from resorting to smugglers in order to reach them &ndash; their impact have been impressive. By the end of October 2015, after which point these different operations either stopped for the winter or moved their activities to the Eastern Mediterranean, non-governmental vessels had rescued over 18,000 people, accounting for 7.6 percent of all rescued people (see <!--<a href=#>annex</a>-->annex).

        {% include footnote-block.html content='M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, &ldquo;Migration: MSF ends search and rescue operations in the central Mediterranean after 20,129 people rescued in 2015&rdquo;, 5 January 2016, <a href="http://www.msf.org/article/migration-msf-ends-search-and-rescue-operations-central-mediterranean-after-20129-people">http://www.msf.org/article/migration-msf-ends-search-and-rescue-operations-central-mediterranean-after-20129-people</a> (last accessed 14 April 2016).' %}

        </p>

        <p>As we can see from these successive shifts, in the aftermath of April 2015, state-led presence at sea has risen again to a level similar to that of MN, with the addition of nongovernmental actors. While this did somewhat diminish the danger of crossing in the second half of 2015, 2,892 deaths have been recorded by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in the central Mediterranean in 2015. This figure is almost identical to that of 2014 (3,186), and the mortality rate for both years is also comparable (see <!--<a href=#>annex</a>-->annex).</p>


        <p>The only factor that succeeded in significantly curbing the danger of crossing in 2015 has not been a state or non-state operation at sea, whether aimed at policing the border or at rescuing people. Rather, this has been the decision of migrants themselves to change their route as of May 2015 from the central to the eastern Mediterranean; that is, from a longer and much more dangerous route to a much shorter and relatively safer stretch of sea.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='This is also the finding of the Unravelling the Mediterranean Migration Crisis (MEDMIG) project.

        While 806 deaths have been recorded this year in the eastern Mediterranean, this number is proportionally much lower in relation to the 856,723 arrivals in Greece than it would have been in the central Mediterranean, leading to a dramatic <em>decrease</em> in the overall mortality rate for the Mediterranean crossing as a whole from 15 percent in 2014 to 3.7 percent in 2015 (see <!--<a href=#>annex</a>-->annex). This is, in relation to the figures that have been calculated to date, the lowest mortality rate in the last 15 years.

        This trend, however, risks being reversed in the aftermath of the EU&rsquo;s agreement with Turkey at the end of 2015. Turkey has, at the end of 2015, demonstrated efforts to enforce tougher controls in the Aegean &ndash; which has unsurprisingly coincided with increasing cases of deaths in Aegean Sea, despite the increasing number of NGOs, activists and humanitarian actors carrying out rescue operations at sea in that area.

        The recent deployment of a NATO operation in the Aegean Sea to &ldquo;stem illegal trafficking and illegal migration&rdquo; risks only reinforcing this trend.

        While migrants&rsquo; crossings in the central and eastern Mediterranean show no sign of abating, we can expect more tragedies to come over the coming year.</p>

        <p>As a result of the redeployment of EU member states and agencies, joined by nongovernmental rescue missions, in the aftermath of the April shipwrecks, the reliance on merchant ships for SAR operations has all but stopped. Few cases of death by rescue have been recorded, despite the notable exception of the 5 August case, in which close to 300 people died when the Irish military ship <em>L&Eacute; Niamh</em> approached in order to rescue them. Despite the crew of the <em>Niamh</em> deploying two Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIB) according to standard procedure,

        the survivors we interviewed told us that their boat capsized because it was taking in water and there were big waves that destabilised it. This case only demonstrates that such tragedies can occur despite the highest level of means dedicated to SAR and that even increasing state-led search and rescue is not in and of itself a sufficient solution.</p>

               As the report demonstrates, even in the presence of the record means deployed by the Mare Nostrum operation, the danger of crossing remained high, because without avenues for legal and safe migration available, migrants continued to need to resort to smugglers and perilous means of crossing. Only a fundamental reorientation from a policy that seeks to select and block migrants&rsquo; movements to one that would grant legal and safe passage, thereby making both smugglers and the very need to rescue migrants at sea obsolete, may stop the list of more than 20,000 recorded cases of deaths at sea since the beginning of the 1990 from growing ever longer.
