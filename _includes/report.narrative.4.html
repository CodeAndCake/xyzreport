				<p>While in the previous section we addressed the institutional process of ending Mare Nostrum (MN) and not replacing it by the Frontex operation Triton, we now turn to the effects these policy decisions produced in the operational situation that emerged at sea in early 2015, and how the increased risks to the lives of migrants that was forecast but disregarded materialised. As already mentioned, compared to MN, Triton had fewer available assets that were patrolling a smaller area extending up to thirty nautical miles from Lampedusa, instead of proactively patrolling the waters immediately off the Libyan coast as MN had done.

				 Moreover, the aim of Triton was border control and not rescue at sea, and it therefore involved a very different spatial and operational logic. Search and Rescue (SAR) activities were now only to be operated as a secondary outcome of its border patrols, and Frontex assets would only be deployed towards SAR operations if called upon to do so by the Italian Coast Guard.</p>

		            THE R&Ouml;SLER LETTER: DEFENDING RETREAT
		          </span></h3>
		        </div>


				<p>This is precisely what happened in early November, just days after the beginning of Triton. Faced with the gap in rescue capabilities determined by the phasing out of MN, the Maritime Rescue and Coordination Center (MRCC) in Rome started to call upon Frontex assets to operate SAR operations that, as predicted by the human rights advocates mentioned in the previous section, continued to occur outside Triton operational area and close to the Libyan coast. In response to this, on 25 November 2014, Klaus R&ouml;sler, Frontex Director of Operations Division, wrote a letter to Giovanni Pinto, Italian General Director of Immigration and Border Police, to voice his &ldquo;concerns about engagement of Frontex deployed assets in activities outside the operational area&rdquo;, as the letter&rsquo;s subject line reads. Quotes from the letter were leaked to the press already in early December 2014, but the full document was released to us by Frontex only recently (see <a href=#>annex</a>).
					{% include footnote-block.html content='Part of the document remains blacked out pursuant to the exception laid down in regulations concerning public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.' %}</p>


				<p>In the letter, highlighting that &ldquo;the operational aim of Frontex joint maritime operations is [&hellip;] to control irregular migration flows towards the territory of the European Union and to tackle cross border crime&rdquo;, R&ouml;sler refers to two main SAR events that had occurred in November 2014, the second of which is the most interesting in the frame of our current discussion. In this event, MRCC Rome requested that a Frontex asset not support a specific SAR event but that it sail to &ldquo;a given area according to the fact of numerous satellite phone calls received&rdquo;. Here R&ouml;sler argued that Frontex assets should only be dispatched after &ldquo;indication of a state of emergency (Uncertainty phase; Alert phase; Distress phase)&rdquo; had been defined. While formally reaffirming Frontex&rsquo;s readiness &ldquo;to support well-grounded national efforts of MS [Member States] as regards international Search and Rescue (SAR) obligations&rdquo;, the letter ends with the suggestion &ldquo;to ensure management of Frontex deployed assets in SAR events [&hellip;] in line with Operational Plan&rdquo;, which, as stated earlier, defines border control as its priority.</p>

		          The letter shows the extent to which Frontex was using technical arguments to voice its reticence about carrying out rescue operations and to seek to limit its assets being called upon to intervene outside Triton&rsquo;s operational area. This was at least the interpretation of a group of Members of the European Parliament, including the above-quoted Barbara Spinelli who, a few days later, at the 11 December 2014 LIBE meeting, asked Angelino Alfano, in his role as representative of the Italian Presidency of the EU and Italian Minister of Interior, &ldquo;to oblige Frontex to abide to its SAR duties enshrined in EU regulations.&rdquo;

		        </div>

				<p>The first effects of the retreat of state-led SAR capabilities in the central Mediterranean began to make themselves felt in a series of incidents that occurred between early December and early March 2015. In this period, contrary to the assumptions that led to the demise of MN, migrants&rsquo; crossings continued unabated and the number of arrivals recorded in the first four months of 2015 remained almost identical to the first four months of 201 (more than 26,000). Furthermore, the smugglers&rsquo; modus operandi did not change, and the use of subpar navigation equipment continued to produce the necessity for SAR interventions very close to the Libyan coast. However, there was now no longer a fleet of state-operated vessels positioned close to the coast to detect and rescue them.</p>

    			{% include image-block.html image='3.2.4-JORA6_130416.jpg' caption='Synthetic map and figures of the situation in the central Mediterranean, January &ndash; May 2015. Frontex and Coast Guard data show that migrants continued to be mainly rescued very close to Libyan shores, as was the case during 2014 when the Mare Nostrum operational was in place. However, the Triton operational area was now much further north in relation to the location of situations of distress. In this phase, the share of rescues operated by the Italian navy dropped from 50 (2014) to 26 percent, while the share of commercial vessels soared to 30 percent. While arrivals stayed stable in relation to 2014, the number of deaths peaked, leading to the migrant mortality to increase 30-fold, from 2 deaths in 1,000 crossings to 60 in 1,000, with peaks in February and April in function of the cases of deaths investigated by this report.

				<p>Two main mechanisms led to increased deaths as a result of this vacuum in SAR capabilities. First, in some instances, boats were left to drift for days before being detected and, once detected, it took many more hours for rescue vessels to reach the location of distress, due to their positioning much further away from the location of SAR events. This was made apparent by the cases of the 22 January and 8 February that cost in total an estimated toll of 365 deaths, producing a peak in the mortality rate for the period.
					{% include footnote-block.html content='Another case reported by the press on 5 December 2014 in which around 18 people died of hypothermia after drifting in cold weather for several hours, seem to also fall in this category, but regrettably we could not access enough evidence to reconstruct the event in detail.

				Secondly, as began to be apparent with the case of 3 March, in order to cope with this SAR vacuum, MRCC Rome was increasingly forced to mobilise commercial vessels operating in the area for SAR activities. However, filling this gap with inadequately equipped commercial vessels would lead to cases of death by rescue.</p>


				<p>These cases thus represented clear warnings of the effects of the EU&rsquo;s policy of retreat from state-led search and rescue operations. Almost every single one of these incidents was reported in the press and critically commented upon by state actors and the human rights community. These warnings of the predictably larger tragedies to come remained unheeded to by EU policy makers and agencies.</p>

				<p>According to testimonies collected by Amnesty International (AI) in the Safi migrant detention centre in Malta, on 15 January 2015, a small rubber boat carrying some 122 people left the shores of Garabouli in Libya at about 16:00 GMT.

				hey were told by armed smugglers to continue straight ahead and they would reach Italy. They had no telephones, water or food, and no life jackets. After a few days, fuel ran out and they started to drift. The dinghy started taking in water and they had no buckets to empty it out. The passengers became extremely cold, thirsty and hungry. A survivor described people &ldquo;losing their minds&rdquo; and jumping into the water. Other drank seawater. In its summary of the case, Amnesty describes the detection of the migrants&rsquo; boat as follows:</p>

				<p>Neither the Maltese authorities nor Triton assets had been able to detect the boat despite it entering Malta&rsquo;s territorial waters and almost reaching the country&rsquo;s shores. Up to 34 people died. 88 young men from Sub-Saharan Africa were saved, but one died in hospital shortly after the rescue.

      			{% include bold-block.html content='This incident offered a first signal of two trends: first, the fact that the smugglers sent out the boat in the middle of the winter without even providing a satellite phone indicated the continuation of the increasingly reckless practices of smugglers, whom, with or without Mare Nostrum, were offering substandard security levels, even in relation to the practice established several years prior by smuggling networks for whom satellite phones had been part of the standard &ldquo;kit&rdquo;. On the other hand, the fact that the vessel was allowed to drift for around eight days and to reach the island of Malta, 400 km further north, was certainly indicative of the lack of patrols operating in this space after the end of Mare Nostrum, and the consequent gap in detection and rescue capabilities.' %}

				<p>On 8 February 2015, MRCC Rome directed its assets towards several boat in distress located at about 120 nm from Lampedusa and 40nm from Tripoli. However, because of the SAR vacuum, the deployment of rescue took several hours, which cost more lives as the passengers faced severe meteorological conditions. Furthermore, some of the passengers even perished after rescue had taken place, during the 18 hours that it took for the patrol boats to sail back to Lampedusa. The survivors interviewed by Amnesty estimated that about 105 people were on board each of the four dinghies. With only 86 passengers rescued, it is probable that some 330 of their fellow travellers perished at sea.</p>


				<p>Amnesty International (AI) interviewed the 86 survivors of this series of shipwrecks soon after their arrival at the beginning of February 2015. Additionally, we have accessed the detailed SAR report from Frontex (hereafter abbreviated as FX), and AIS data (for which, probably because of the bad weather conditions, coverage was poor). The following chain of events emerges from these sources. Based on its interviews, Amnesty summarised the first phases of the events as follows:</p>

		                  “Some 420 migrants left together from the Libyan port town of Garabouli, 40km west of Tripoli, in four inflatable dinghies. Most were young men from West Africa. People smugglers had kept them near Tripoli to await the journey after charging them the equivalent of around 650 euros. On the evening of 7 February, the smugglers, armed, made them board the dinghies, which were numbered 1 to 4. The boats were powered by small outboard motors, and the smugglers had not provided enough petrol for the trip. [&hellip;] Early on 8 February, the boats drifted in the Mediterranean Sea north of Libya, in serious danger. High waves were washing people off the dinghies and into the sea.”

				<p>According to the detailed SAR report provided to us by Frontex, at 11:50 GMT, MRCC Rome received a call from an operator of the reception centre, Corcolle. The caller reported that she in turn had been contacted by one of the passengers on board via satellite phone, who said there were about 300 migrants and that they had been drifting for about 13 hours. At 12:03 GMT, the satellite telephone in question was located in position <strong>33&deg;49'N - 013&deg;41 'E </strong>(FX), that is, approximately 120 nm from Lampedusa and 40 nm from Tripoli. This was the first of several contacts with the migrants&rsquo; boats as indicated in the map above.</p>


				<p>At 13:30 GMT, MRCC Rome managed to reach the passengers via the satellite telephone number. This time the migrants reported to be 105 persons on board, adrift and without water or food. MRCC Rome declared this a SAR event (FX). At 13:50 GMT, MRCC Rome sent out the following distress signal to all vessels transiting through the area with the position it had established for the vessel at 12.03 GMT:</p>

				<p>The poor coverage of the AIS vessel tracking data at the time (probably as a result of the severe meteorological conditions) does not allow us to ascertain with precision the location of the different vessels at the time. However, because of the time it took them to navigate towards the location of the SAR event, it appears that the coast guard vessels were located near Lampedusa (this is confirmed by Frontex for at least two assets). Neither were any commercial vessel accounted for by the AIS data located in proximity at the time of the distress signal. The Italian Coast Guard&rsquo;s vessels CP 302, CP 305, CP 312 and CP 319 (two of which were coordinated by the Frontex operation Triton) were dispatched to the location of the vessels in distress.

				While AIS data shows the Saint Rock changing its course towards the location of the boat in distress at 12:17 GMT, the Bourbon Argos, for which only the position at 12:17 GMT is available, was the first to reach one of the rubber boats.

Throughout this time, the passengers had to remain on deck for lack of space inside and could enter the cabin only for short periods, on rotation. The CP 302 and 319 arrived at the island at 14:40 GMT on 9 February, carrying 58 people including the 29 people who had died; the CP 305 and 312 returned at 18:25 GMT, carrying 46 people (FX).</p>

				Following her account, the rescuers run out of survival blankets on board since these kept flying away due to strong winds.

Among the eight members of the crew (six coast guard personnel, one doctor and one paramedic), all of whom were also feeling sick due to extreme conditions, only the scuba diver was equipped to go on deck to check the conditions of the passengers.

However, when the <em>Bourbon Argos</em> and the <em>Bremer Martha</em> conducted the rescue, they realised that only seven passengers were still alive (AI and FX). At 16:47 GMT, the rescue operation by the two merchant vessels was complete (FX).</p>

				<p>The <strong>fourth and last boat</strong> <strong>was localised at </strong><strong>34-12N 013-32E </strong><strong>at 21.28 GMT</strong>, as stated in a hydrolant distress signal sent out by MRCC Rome to vessels transiting through the area&nbsp;at 05:05 GMT of the following day:</p>

				<p>According to the Frontex report, which only provides scant information regarding this event, the <em>Bourbon Argos</em> tugboat was re-directed to this area, which it reached at 12.48 GMT, and recovered the two remaining passengers in <strong>34'01'N </strong><strong>- </strong><strong>013'52'E</strong>.</p>

				<p>As in the 22 January case described above, the deaths of migrants in these four interrelated cases were directly linked to the gap in SAR capability left by the ending of MN and its (non-)replacement by Triton. While the smugglers behaved murderously by sending the migrants out in extreme meteorological conditions, the gap left in rescue capacity meant that there were no assets located near the Libyan coast, which might have allowed for the rescue of the migrants before the weather worsened. Even once they could be rescued, the unavailability of larger SAR vessels that could shelter the migrants below deck led to further deaths, as the case of the first boat shows clearly. With MN in place, it would have taken less time to reach the passengers; furthermore, the large military ships of the MN operation &ndash; some of which had medical operating rooms and doctors on board and could shelter large number of migrants below deck &ndash; would surely have provided better conditions to care for the passengers during the long hours of navigation back to Lampedusa. Finally, in addition to the vacuum left by the ending of MN, it appears that the two largest vessels part of Triton &ndash; the Icelandic <em>Tyr</em> and an Italian navy vessel, presumably the <em>Libra</em> &ndash; were in maintenance in Malta and at a port in Sicily and therefore unable to intervene, further diminishing the already reduced SAR capability in the central Mediterranean.

				<p>In the aftermath of these shipwrecks, several high level politicians and international organisations criticised Operation Triton, Frontex and the EU at large for failing to address the humanitarian catastrophe that was, once more, unfolding in the Mediterranean Sea.

				<p>With both the Italian government and EU institutions remaining firm in their decision not to (re-)launch a large-scale SAR operation that could fill the deadly gap left by the end of MN, MRCC Rome sought to patch it by relying on the inadequate means of commercial vessels. While commercial vessels were already involved in some of the cases above, an incident in early March offered a clear indication of the deadly effects this recourse could have.</p>

				<p>On 3 March 2015, a shipwreck occurred just as a migrants&rsquo; vessel was reaching a tugboat that had come to rescue them, in a eerie anticipation of the events of the Black Week that we reconstruct in the next section. In order to reconstruct this case, we have relied on a detailed SAR report released to us by Frontex (FX), distress signals, AIS data, interviews with a few of the survivors conducted by Amnesty International (AI)

				<p>As the Frontex report indicates, the boat had left in the night of 2/3 March 2015 carrying 153 people, including some 4 women and 2 children. While the information in our possession does not allow us to clarify at what time a distress call was placed, at 11:49 GMT, MRCC Rome sent out the following distress signal, indicating the position of three boats in distress in the area (see map above):</p>

				<p>At <strong>13:20 GMT</strong>, the Frontex report states that a &ldquo;wooden boat&rdquo; was sighted by the tugboat <em>OOC Cougar</em> at position <strong>33 27&rsquo;N 012 24&rsquo;E&rdquo;</strong>, approximately 6 nm north-east of the position of boat A indicated on the Hydrolant message and showed on the map. We can thus assume that these positions refer to the same migrants&rsquo; boat. However, as the migrants&rsquo; boat approached the large tug boat (73.60 M X 16.0 M) and the passengers tried to catch the ladder that the crew of the tug boat had thrown to them, the movement of the passengers on board caused the boat to capsize &ndash; according to the Frontex report at 14:44 GMT.</p>

				<p>The photographs and their metadata show the migrants&rsquo; boat approaching at 14:36 GMT, and the crew on board the <em>OOC Cougar</em> swiftly lowering a rope to the migrants. We also see a crewmember with a megaphone communicating with the passengers. However, the next photograph taken at 14:48 GMT shows the passengers in the water, a life raft having been lowered. The last photograph that was released was taken after the rescue at 16:57 GMT and shows the passengers on board the <em>OOC Cougar</em> draped in survival blankets and the rafts being lowered. We also see another tugboat of the <em>Asso</em> family in the distance, probably the <em>Asso Ventiquattro</em>, which, according to AIS data, was present in vicinity.</p>


				<p>According to the press release of the Italian Coast Guard, shortly after the migrants&rsquo; boat capsized, the Italian coast guard vessel, <em>Dattilo</em> (CP 940) joined the rescue efforts with 318 people rescued in a previous operation already on board. The Italian Navy vessels <em>Fugolsi</em> (financed by Frontex) and <em>Bersagliere</em> also took part. According to Frontex, At 21:49 GMT, 98 people had been rescued by the <em>OOC Cougar</em>, 12 by the <em>Asso</em> vessel, 11 people and 10 dead bodies recovered by the <em>Bersagliere</em>. Of the 153 people who were initially on board, more than 30 died.</p>


				<p>According to the press release by the Italian Coast Guard, that day, 941 people were rescued in seven SAR events, all in an area close to 50 nm from the coast of Libya. Three different merchant ships, two coast guard vessels and one ship of the Italian Navy financed by Frontex participated in the rescue efforts of a total of seven migrants&rsquo; boats. This information does not only give a scale of the vast amount of SAR events that were happening at the time, but also of the huge involvement of the shipping industry.</p>

      			{% include bold-block.html content='The 3 March shipwreck was thus indicative not only of the growing trend towards the privatization of recue as the result of the retreat of state assets dedicated to SAR close to Libyan coast, but also of its potentially lethal effects.' %}


				<p>The commercial shipping community had already emerged as a crucial actor during MN, when it started to be involved in rescue operations on an unprecedented level compared to previous years: over the whole year of 2014, according to the data compiled by the Italian Coast Guard, some 600 commercial vessels were diverted to rescue 42,061 people in 2014, representing 25 percent of the total number, second to the Italian Navy. However, as the data compiled by Frontex indicates, the share of commercial vessels (indicated as &ldquo;civilian vessels&rdquo;) grew during the phasing out of MN: in December 2014, it represented close to 40 percent of the total number diverted to conduct rescue operations. Thus, it is unsurprising that with the ending of Mare Nostrum, this trend grew and consolidated: of the 39,250 people rescued between 1 January and 20 May 2015, 11,954 were rescued by cargo ships. This represented 30 percent of the total of the rescued people, thus making the shipping industry the primary actor conducting rescue operations in the central Mediterranean.</p>

				<p>Previously long opposed and criminalized, the mobilisation of merchant ships for rescue activities had since 2014 not only been encouraged but actively called upon by the Italian Coast Guard, and increasingly so since the end of MN. While commercial vessels have contributed to saving thousands of people, their involvement has also posed serious challenges in terms of safety. Commercial ships are not designed to safely approach boats that are much smaller, overcrowded and unstable. Furthermore, they often have a very limited crew, who are not specifically trained or equipped to carry out the extremely perilous operations necessary to rescue an overcrowded boat on the open seas.
					{% include footnote-block.html content='On the dangers of rescue by merchant ships see also Amnesty International, <em>Europe&rsquo;s Sinking Shame: The Failure to Save Refugees and Migrants at Sea</em>, April 2015, pp 17-18.' %} 
				As such, and without diminishing the importance of the efforts of the shipping community, it is not surprising that their massive involvement in rescue operations led to cases of shipwrecks. Despite their intentions, the commercial vessels became not merely involved in the rescue efforts, but in the sequence of events that led to the situation of distress and ultimately death of the migrants. Stuck between the shifting practices of smugglers whose operational mode had been adapted to the presence of MN on the one hand, and the EU policy makers&rsquo; reluctance to provide assistance at sea on the other, the excessive mobilisation of private vessels for rescue operations led to <em>assistance becoming deadly</em>.</p>



				<p>The 3 March incident was not unprecedented in demonstrating the risks of privatised rescue. Already on 7 June 2014, a raft carrying 107 migrants overturned just as it was approaching the an oil tanker flying the Maltese flag, the<em> Norient Star</em>. The accident caused the death of 5 people.

				<p>Following this event, and the materialisation of the increasing recourse to the shipping industry, a coalition of shipping industry organisations, led by European Community Shipowners&rsquo; Associations (ECSA) and the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), wrote an open letter to the EU member states and institutions on 31 March 2015.

				<p>This letter, written less than two weeks before the large scale shipwrecks of April, by the actors who, despite themselves, were being put on the frontline of rescue in the central Mediterranean as the result of the retreat of EU member states and agencies, could not be more clear in terms of the increasing risk entailed by the excessive mobilisation of merchant ships. But just as with the warnings that followed the 8 February shipwrecks that had resulted from the vacuum in SAR capability, these signals and calls denouncing the dangerous privatization of rescue used to fill it were left attended to and unanswered. In this context, the April shipwrecks were only waiting to happen.</p>
