        <p>While the criticism that MN led to more crossings and more deaths was thus unfounded, these arguments were put forward by EU member states and agencies to respond negatively to Italy&rsquo;s calls to hand over MN to the EU by transforming Frontex&rsquo;s central Mediterranean operation into a Europeanised Mare Nostrum. Instead, a much more limited operation called &ldquo;Triton&rdquo; would be implemented by Frontex.</p>

          The deadly effects of the rapid removal of MN were predicted by several actors, including EU agencies, but across EU institutional bodies and agencies the warnings were ignored. In what follows, we offer a reconstruction of this process of institutional wilful neglect that spans from April 2014 to January 2015.

        On 24 June, presenting his priorities for the then upcoming Italian presidency of the Council of the EU, Italian Prime Minister Renzi stated that Italy would request at an EU Council summit a few days later that &ldquo;MN becomes an operation part of Frontex&rdquo;.

        <p>Over the summer of 2014, a long and sinuous institutional process unfolded during which the contours of the Frontex mission were debated and defined, ultimately leading to a much more limited mission that was a far cry from Italy&rsquo;s request that Frontex &ldquo;take on the duties of Mare Nostrum&rdquo;.

        At the 26&ndash;27 June European Council meeting, the Council concluded vaguely that &ldquo;Frontex should reinforce its operational assistance, in particular to support Member States facing strong pressure at the external borders.&rdquo; This was enough for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to state on 29 June 2014 that &ldquo;today, Italy is less alone in the Mediterranean&rdquo;, asserting that the agreement regarding migration policies reached at the European summit is &ldquo;a truly significant step forward&rdquo; because it established &ldquo;the basis for being able to finally breathe life into a Frontex &lsquo;-plus&rsquo;, broadening its operations&rdquo

        However, the limits of the MN substitute operation proposed by the EU became clear when, following the EU Minister of Interiors and Minister of Justice Informal Meeting on July 9 in Milan, Home Affairs Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m&nbsp;said that she was discussing with Alfano what was needed for a &ldquo;scaled-down&rdquo; version of Mare Nostrum:</p>

        <p>On 28 August, Frontex issued a &ldquo;concept document&rdquo; on the future of Frontex&rsquo;s Hermes and Aeneas operations in the central Mediterranean (see (see <a href=#>annex</a>)). Written at a time when the ending of MN had not yet been formally announced, the document proposed that operation Hermes 2014 either be extended in the case of the continuation of MN, or be upgraded to new operation Triton if MN was terminated. The document contains two sections: first, an assessment aiming to &ldquo;provide analytical support to decision making at Frontex&rdquo;; and second, the proposal that emerged from this decision making. Crucially, the assessment notes that:</p>

        <p>In the actual proposal however, considering the scenario in which MN is terminated, the operational zones of Hermes and Aneas are effectively merged into a new Triton operation, but are not extended further south, thus remaining far from the extent of MN (see map comparing zones).</p>

              Frontex was thus aware that ending MN abruptly could lead to an increased risk of migrants&rsquo; deaths, and that as such specific counter-measures should have been taken, including extending the operational zone. It decided, however, to ignore this risk and not to follow its own internal recommendation in the actual proposal for the new operation.

        <p>The minutes of the meetings held between August and October 2014 by Frontex, Italian and Maltese agencies, and the EU Commission (see <a href=#>annex</a>)provide further examples of how these concerns were not considered at an operational level. In these meetings, Italy repeatedly requested that more important means be dedicated to the Frontex operation being defined, including Navy assets, but Frontex responded that this was beyond the means allocated to the operation and defended its operation&rsquo;s spatial retreat.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='During it&rsquo;s meeting in Rome on 25-26 August 2014, Italy &ldquo;presented to all participants their proposal on a new concept of JO EPN Hermes as already discussed during the meeting held in Frontex on 20 August 2014.&rdquo; Among other things, the Italian proposal noted that &ldquo;[a] large involvement of maritime and aerial assets from EU Member States and SAL is foreseen, the presence of the EU in the border surveillance of the Central Med has to become significant.&rdquo; However, during the same meeting, Frontex &ldquo;made a clear statement as regards the future operational area of EPN Hermes, namely that FX would not agree on having an operational area within Libya&#39;s SAR.&rdquo; Furthermore Frontex &ldquo;informed that at the moment the agency has no financial means to accommodate the ITA proposal on the deployment of certain type (OPV&rsquo;s) and quantity of additional assets.&rdquo; Frontex, Mission report for 25-26 August 2014 meetings in Rome, 26 August 2014 (see annex).' %}

        <p>During none of the meetings between Italy and Frontex, including after the ending of MN was formally announced in October, were concrete measures planned by Frontex or Italy in response to this warning, nor to the increased risks to the lives of migrants it would entail.

        <p>While the risk to the lives of migrants was simply absent from Frontex&rsquo;s operational meetings with member states, there were other opportunities within EU institutional bodies to give heed to this concern. This was the case for instance of the hearing at the European Parliament&rsquo;s committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) held on 3 and 4 September.

        <p>It is worth quoting the minutes of this meeting (see <a href=#>annex</a>) at length. The intervention of Arias is particularly important. In it, Arias reiterated the criticism of Mare Nostrum being a pull-factor and representing an increased danger for migrants at sea that we have tackled above. As a consequence, he specified that:</p>

        <p>On 5 December 2014, Fran&ccedil;ois Cr&eacute;peau, United Nations Rapporteur on the rights of migrants warned:</p>

            “The fear is that, next summer, without an operation like Mare Nostrum, thousands of people will die. Turning a blind eye isn&rsquo;t a solution: people will continue to cross and, because of Europe&rsquo;s inaction, to die”

        <p>These warnings stemming from within EU agencies, EU institutional bodies, UN organisations and human rights NGOs were not heeded to. On 9&ndash;10 October, the Justice and Home Affairs Council welcomed the launch of Triton, due on 1 November, and Italy&rsquo;s Interior Minister Angelino Alfano formally announced the that Operation Mare Nostrum would end by the end of the year.

        After a period of &ldquo;phasing out&rdquo; between November and December, from 1 January 2015, the central Mediterranean was left with Triton, which had a much smaller budget &ndash; initially 2.9 million euros per month &ndash; and fewer available assets patrolling a smaller area, extending up to thirty nautical miles from Lampedusa.

        <p>Why were the increased risk to the lives of migrants either disregarded or not mentioned at all by Frontex and EU member states? Fran&ccedil;ois Cr&eacute;peau, United Nations Rapporteur on the rights of migrants, provided his own interpretation on 30 October 2014. On this occasion he was responding to the statement by UK Foreign Office Minister Lady Anelay, who justified her decision to axe UK support to SAR operations in the Mediterranean by accusing them of being a pull-factor.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='On Wednesday 15 October 2014, in UK Parliament, Lady Anelay stated: &ldquo;We do not support planned search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. We believe that they create an unintended &ldquo;pull factor&rdquo;, encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths.&rdquo; See <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldhansrd/text/141015w0001.htm">http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldhansrd/text/141015w0001.htm</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016).' %}

        <p>While Cr&eacute;peau&rsquo;s statement was only a well-grounded deduction, the newly released Frontex&rsquo;s Tactical focused assessment for Triton from 14 January 2015 confirms that the rationale for this retreat of state-operated rescue was indeed to act as a deterrent for migrants and smugglers in the aim of stemming crossings:</p>

<!-- QUOTE -->
        <div class="quote">
          <div class="quote-text">
            “The end of Operation Mare Nostrum on 31 December 2014 will have a direct impact on the JO Triton 2014. The fact that most interceptions and rescue missions will only take place inside the operational area could become a deterrence for facilitation networks and migrants that can only depart from, the Libyan or Egyptian coast with favourable weather conditions and taking into account that the boat must now navigate for several days before being rescued or intercepted.”

              From all of the above, what emerges is that in the ending of MN and the planning of Triton, the aim of Frontex and EU member states of seeking to deter the arrivals of migrants took precedent over taking into account the information concerning the additional risks that the cutting back of interception/rescue operations would entail for the lives of migrants. More than that, the increased risks to the lives of migrants that were being publically evoked on numerous occasions were never considered in any operational decision and consistently remained outside the purview of EU decision makers.
