Carousel double image - get arrow to show up

[15/04/2016, 12:50:46] Lorenzo Pezzani: also another thing to do while the next section is being prepared is to substitute a couple of images
[15/04/2016, 12:50:57] Lorenzo Pezzani: in the Summary section:
[15/04/2016, 12:53:01] Lorenzo Pezzani: 2.-MORTALITY-14-15_B 2.jpg
[15/04/2016, 12:54:28] Lorenzo Pezzani: and in Report>main narrative>background:
[15/04/2016, 12:54:30] Lorenzo Pezzani: 3.1-Migreurop,-militarisation_frame.jpg



Lorenzo report:

- videos can be played fullscreen, only vimeo PRO accounts can customise their player to remove share buttons and `Vimeo' logo - does Charles have PRO account?
- double image is up - need to figure out why arrow won't show up tbc...
- https://www.publitas.com/features/ could be an option for embedding pdfs into the site
