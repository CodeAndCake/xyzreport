				Amnesty International has been unable to send a delegation of researchers to visit the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the conflict in July 2014. The Israeli authorities have refused, up to the time of writing this report, to allow Amnesty International and other international human rights monitors to enter the Gaza Strip through the Erez crossing with Israel, despite the organization’s repeated requests since the beginning of the conflict to do so. The Egyptian authorities have also not granted Amnesty International permission to enter the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, despite the organization’s repeated requests to do so.

				Amnesty International has consequently had to carry out research remotely, supported by two fieldworkers based in Gaza who were contracted to work with the organization for periods of several weeks. They travelled extensively within the Strip, visiting many of the sites described in this report, some more than once, as soon as possible after the attacks took place, interviewing dozens of victims and eyewitnesses and taking photos and videos of the sites. The organization consulted on the interpretation of photos and videos with military experts. It extensively reviewed relevant statements by the Israeli military and other official bodies. Amnesty International also studied relevant documentation produced by UN agencies, Palestinian, Israeli and other non-governmental organizations, local officials, media, and others who monitored the conflict, and consulted with them as needed.

				Despite these efforts, the lack of access for Amnesty International’s researchers, as well as military personnel who would have accompanied them, has clearly hindered the work of Amnesty International, as it has for other human rights organizations wishing to document violations of international law in the Gaza Strip. First-hand examination of sites that have been attacked – both in damaged buildings and elsewhere – help monitors assess how, with what and why something was targeted, but the evidence disappears quickly. Suffering from a great shortage of living space, residents of the Gaza Strip started almost immediately after the conflict to clear up the rubble and use what could be salvaged to rebuild their homes, as after other recent conflicts. Fragments of munitions which would have helped identify which weapons were used have been carried off from the rubble of destroyed homes by civil defence workers, souvenir hunters and others.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="For instance, some individuals picked up fragments of munitions as souvenirs or to use to make practical or decorative objects.

				Governments who wish to hide their violations of human rights from the outside world have frequently banned Amnesty International from accessing the places in which they have been committed. Although Amnesty International researchers have consistently been able to access Israel and the occupied West Bank, they have not been allowed by the Israeli government to enter the Gaza Strip through the Erez crossing since June 2012. The UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, which was set up by the UN Human Rights Council and reported in 2009 on violations of international law by all sides during Israel’s Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip, criticized this policy, stating: “The Mission is of the view that the presence of international human rights monitors would have been of great assistance in not only investigating and reporting but also in the publicizing of events on the ground.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, <i>Human Rights in Palestine and other Occupied Arab Territories: Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict</a> (A/HRC/12/48), 23 September 2009, para. 1734, <a href='unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/25184E52D3E5CDBA8525763200532E73' target='_blank'>unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/25184E52D3E5CDBA8525763200532E73</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  It added: “The presence of international human rights monitors is likely to have a deterrent effect, dissuading parties to a conflict from engaging in violations of international law.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, <i>Human Rights in Palestine and other Occupied Arab Territories: Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict</a> (A/HRC/12/48), 23 September 2009, para. 1747, <a href='unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/25184E52D3E5CDBA8525763200532E73' target='_blank'>unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/25184E52D3E5CDBA8525763200532E73</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

				On 8 October 2014, Amnesty International sent a memorandum to the three Israeli mechanisms investigating aspects of Operation Protective Edge – the State Comptroller, the army’s General Staff Mechanism for Fact-Finding Assessments, and the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee – as well as to the army’s Chief of General Staff, the Prime Minister and the Ministers of Defense, Justice and Foreign Affairs. The memorandum set out some of the concerns Amnesty International had about the conduct of Israeli forces during Operation Protective Edge and requested responses to these. It requested information on what specific factors were taken into account prior to the deployment of weapons and munitions which have indiscriminate effects when used in densely populated areas, such as mortars and artillery, and on what concrete steps were taken by the IDF to avoid their use in situations where civilians would be at risk. It also requested clarification regarding the criteria used by the IDF to assess the risk to civilians when selecting pre-identified targets for attack, at what point in advance of the proposed attack and at what level of seniority this was done. It asked for details of how the decision was made to attack civilian objects, such as hospitals, ambulances, schools, homes, and other essential infrastructure, on what criteria and at what level of command seniority. It also requested information on the precautions taken in planning and executing attacks on military targets, including Palestinian fighters, to ensure that any harm likely to be caused to civilians in carrying out such attacks would not be disproportionate. It also asked for details of evidence the IDF might have of violations by Hamas and Palestinian armed groups.

				In November 2014 a reply was received from the State Comptroller which described the focus of their inquiry and accepted Amnesty International’s proposal for a meeting. Amnesty International wrote back to the State Comptroller to seek a date for such a meeting but had received no reply before this report was finalized. The organization has received no other response to the memorandum it sent in October 2014.
				</p>
				<p>
				On 15 July 2015, Amnesty International addressed letters to each of the authorities it had contacted on 8 October 2014 to remind them of the outstanding requests to them and to request additional information on cases highlighted in this report. It reiterated its wish to meet the authorities, either before or after the publication of this report.
