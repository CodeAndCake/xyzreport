                    During an ongoing offensive that included missile and tank fire, at 10.53am on 1 August the Israeli military attacked the Abu Shawareb building in the al-Tannur neighbourhood with an air strike. An aerial bomb destroyed the building, killing at least 18 people and injuring scores of others.
                </h4>
                    <p>
On the morning of 1 August, Inam Ouda Ayed bin Hammad, 26, was sheltering with her three children – Anas, 5, Mutasim 6, and Remas, 3 – at her uncle’s home in the al-Tannur neighbourhood, because her own home, on al-Balbisi Street, in the eastern part of Rafah, was built of corrugated metal sheets and not safe. Inam bin Hammad told Amnesty International that she heard repeated attacks in the vicinity of her uncle’s home. Three of her nieces, two of whom are children, were also there. “It was just me and my children as my husband was out helping another family [the Emran family] whose house had been shelled,” she recounts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
After 9am the shelling intensified and munitions were falling close by. Inam bin Hammad and her family decided to leave the house as the situation was getting more dangerous. “I decided to seek shelter in my brother Fathi’s home, only two houses away... I went there with my three children and my three nieces,” she recounts. “The minute I left the house and was between my uncle’s and brother’s houses, an Apache [helicopter] started shooting at us… I banged on my brother’s door asking him to open up.” Members of the Abu Hani family were also taking shelter there; the family’s mother and her five children were later killed.

                    <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
“We were there for about an hour and a half, while munitions continued to fall in close vicinity. My uncle Nasser [al-Mahmoum] and cousin Jihad [al-Mahmoum] were both injured by the shelling. We were afraid the situation would turn into a massacre like al-Shuja’iyyeh.
<br>
“Hani, who later died, came and told us we had to leave like everyone else. When we opened the door, I saw another family walking down the road, so I thought to myself since it was safe for them, we should go with them.”
            </div>
            <div class="quote-source">Inam Ouda Ayed bin Hammad</div>
        </div>
                        <p>
Inam bin Hammad and her three children, together with other relatives and members of the Mustafa family, left her brother’s house and proceeded to walk down the street to seek safety elsewhere. She was carrying her daughter Remas and her cousin Wafa was carrying her son Anas. They passed about six houses with great difficulty, while munitions of all kinds were landing in their close vicinity. “The shells were raining down on us,” Inam bin Hammad recounts. “If you were hit by one of those, it could cut you in half.”
                        </p>
                            <p>
She recounts the moments before an attack struck a main street in the al-Tannur neighbourhood close to the Abu Shawareb building. It led to the death of her son Anas, her cousin Wafa and several others and injured scores of those who were fleeing on the streets:
                            </p>
                            <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
“As soon as we crossed to the paved road I felt safer. I reached the paved road first and, as my cousin was starting to cross over, my brother shouted at her not to cross as they might shell the road. I looked behind me and found Wafa and the others telling me to go back. There was no way for me to go back. Wafa and her mother and my son remained behind us. At the same time, people from the al-Tannur area arrived on the street that comes out of ‘Abu Shawar’ – around 60 of them. 
<br>
“The last thing I saw was my son carried by Wafa and he was looking for me – I shouted ‘here I am, here I am’ and suddenly there was smoke, dust and rubble and shrapnel flying above.”

        </div>
                        <p>
A concrete slab fell on top of her and she lost consciousness for several minutes before realizing that her leg was severely injured. She managed to stand up and find her daughter Remas and then her niece Heba, who had sustained severe injuries in her leg and was unable to walk, and help her out of the rubble. Heba was later transferred to Turkey for medical treatment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Her cousin Wafa, who had been carrying her son Anas and had taken shelter near the Abu Shawareb building, was killed when a concrete wall collapsed on top of her. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
Inam bin Hammad recounts that when an ambulance came to collect the injured, “a drone dropped a missile to deter it from moving any closer to the house.” The ambulance had to retreat and those who had survived the attack, some of whom were severly bleeding, had to wait for an additional 30 minutes. On al-Balbisi Street, Inam bin Hammad recounts, Dr Mohammed al-Balbisi was providing first aid to everyone while the shelling persisted.
                        </p>
                <p>
She describes the situation when another ambulance came:

                <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
“The ambulance did not want to take us, but finally agreed seeing how difficult the situation was. When I looked back as I was getting into the ambulance at the Abu Shawareb building, I saw that it had been shelled. I was sure my son was gone. After I was treated in the hospital, my son’s body was brought in an hour later. They found half of his lower body, which had been carried all the way to near al-Balbisi’s house, but could not find the rest of his body for three days. They later found his head at Ibrahim Hijazi’s house and his hands somewhere else. They never found his upper body.”

            <div class="quote-source">Inam Ouda Ayed bin Hammad</div>
        </div>
                <p>
The attack killed 12 members of the al-Mahmoum family, and several others. 
                </p>
                <p>
These and other accounts by residents of attacks throughout the al-Tannur neighbourhood during the same timeframe indicate that the bombing of the empty Abu Shawareb building when scores of civilians were trying to flee intense bombardment was at best disproportionate. Even if the house did cover an opening to a tunnel, dropping a one-tonne bomb on the building when it could have been foreseen that so many civilians would be killed and injured was clearly disproportionate. The artillery shelling of the area was indiscriminate and the reported helicopter fire at civilians and ambulances amounted to direct attacks on civilians.

“It was a black day. I cannot think of a worse day,” says Abdel-Rahim Abdel-Karim Lafi. On the morning of 1 August, he was with two of his sons in the al-Tannur neighbourhood, near the Omar Abdel-Aziz Mosque, while his eldest son, wife and daughters were at the market. He recounts:

“The shelling started at 9am or 9.15am. My son Yehya [who later died] was on the balcony and told me people were running away. Then my eldest son called and said the police were not allowing anyone into the area near the Abu Youssef al-Najjar roundabout because of the shelling… and told me to leave the house.”

He and his son Yehya decided to leave the house and walk in the direction of the Abu Youssef al-Najjar roundabout, where they were injured in an attack by what appeared to be a drone:
                        </p>

“We reached the Abu Youssef al-Najjar roundabout when the first missile fell about 13m ahead of us. I was walking in front of my son and told him to walk behind me so that, if anything happened, the missile would hit me and not him. I wanted to protect him. I fell and was injured in my right leg. When I looked next to me I found my son. He looked up at me for seconds and died immediately after. When the first missile fell, two women to the right on the road towards Abu Youssef al-Najjar roundabout died.”

                        <p>
A moment later, while Abdel-Rahim Lafi was sitting on the ground beside his dead son, a second missile struck “about 8m away from me”, and he saw a young man in a blue shirt fly into the air. He says: 
                        </p>
                        <div class="quote">

“A man yelled at me to move away, to move back, which I did, while the shelling continued. People were running, some were dying, many were injured. The [attacks] were coming from the eastern areas.”

        </div>
                        <p>
After realizing that the ambulance was unable to access the area, Abdel-Rahim Lafi walked to the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital to find his older son. “They brought [Yehya] in and I said my goodbyes to him before they put him in the refrigerator, while the rest of my children watched,” he remembers. “The doctor X-rayed my leg and said I had shrapnel in it and I would need a drip. There was chaos in the hospital; I was on the floor with many other patients.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
His brother informed him that his sister’s husband and two children were wounded and were in the hospital. His 60-year-old brother-in-law had a broken leg and an injury next to his heart, with shrapnel injuries all over his body. Both of Abdel-Rahim Lafi’s brother’s sons, aged 11 and 17, sustained serious head injuries and required prolonged medical treatment.
                        </p>
                <p>
Abdel-Rahim Lafi had to evacuate the hospital with others that afternoon amid intensified attacks on its premises. “My wife, children, brother and sister, nine of us, had to leave through the back door of the hospital because the front entrance had unexploded bombs near it. There was shelling next to the hospital, and a missile fell in front of the back entrance,” he recounts. “We left two at a time with my brother and I leaving last. We walked to the al-Jenina district.” He says:
                </p>
                <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
“They were hitting the whole street, from Salah al-Din intersection to the Abu Youssef al-Najjar roundabout to the intersection of Ghaboun to the intersection of al-Madakha, then to where the Madakha road meets Saddam Hussein road. All those intersections were bombed completely.”

        </div>
                <p>
It is possible that one of the intended targets of the attack was a motorcycle that was passing by at the time and may have been carrying a fighter, as local groups reported. Amnesty International was unable to verify whether this was the case. Even if it were true, the use of such massive firepower in a populated neighbourhood indicates that the attack was disproportionate or otherwise indiscriminate.

“We heard neighbours calling out to us to get out. When we did, we started running, while helicopters, F-16 planes and artillery kept bombing.

Mohammed Mahmud Salam Abu al-Saba and his family had taken shelter in schools since the first day of the hostilities.

After a ceasefire was announced on the morning of 1 August, Mohammed al-Saba and his family used a donkey and cart to return to their home in the Mashrou’ Amer area. Mohammed al-Saba says that his 52-year-old sister and his eight young children, three girls and five boys, were caught in that morning’s attacks on Salah al-Din Street:

“So we left the donkey and cart and escaped. We went into a house… and then they struck the cart and the donkey died. Everything, all our belongings we had in our cart was lost.

He found his two missing children, aged four and five, at Zahar school. “They’d escaped with the people. I found them in Zahar school on the way,” he recalls. “I was so worried about getting separated from my children. I thought they’d died. I was going mad looking for them.”

Mohammed al-Saba’s description of the events is corroborated by accounts from many other residents fleeing the area at the same time. Many lost family members in the chaos. The attacks that Mohammed al-Saba describes appeared to be indiscriminate, with all vehicles evidently being targeted without distinction.

An Israeli bombardment in the close vicinity of the home of the Abu Mohsen family north of Salah al-Din Street shortly after 9.30am on 1 August resulted in the death of Saleh Abu Mohsen’s daughter.

                    <p>
An Israeli attack on the family home of Saleh Hussein Abdel-Karim Abu Mohsen, 44, in al-Shuka in eastern Rafah, caused the family to flee onto the street. Saleh Abu Mohsen recalls the situation that morning:

“We heard a huge number of [air strikes and munitions] falling nearby. I would not be exaggerating if I told you that around 50-60 shells were falling every minute. One of the missiles fell while I was in the house and destroyed the fence. Later, another missile fell and the living room door flew about 3m from its frame…
<br>
“I left with my daughters and the wife of our neighbour, walking towards the Mashrou’ Amer intersection, 400m away. We left the house at exactly 11.01am. When we reached there I was surprised to find a [truck] trailer on fire…
<br>
“I found tanks in front of the Sa’ad Sayel barracks. The tanks fired at us. There were four or five tanks on both sides of the road. I looked for a safe house for the girls and the first house I came across was that of al-Sayed Hamdan al-Shaer, known as ‘Ukush’. There was a pregnant woman and children and another woman crying, and the owner of the house.”

He recounts that he had agreed with his daughters beforehand “to walk in two groups separated by a distance of 10m” in case they were hit. “That way some of us stood a chance of being saved and not all would be killed,” he says. When Saleh Abu Mohsen was crossing the Mashrou’ Amer intersection, he looked behind him and could no longer see his eldest daughter, Asil, 17. He says:

“I left two of my daughters there for a few moments and went back to look for my eldest daughter. I called out to her to find her and save her. I could not move forward because of the heavy shelling. It was madness: an incredible number of missiles falling… I took the two girls and ran towards Abu Youssef al-Najjar Street to try and find an ambulance. When I arrived there the ambulances were too busy because so much was happening in eastern Rafah and no one dared go east of the hospital.”

Saleh Abu Mohsen spent five hours at the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital before an order was given to evacuate it. “As we evacuated I passed by the home of the Sarafandi family, which had been annihilated – it added to my fears,” he recounts. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
Four days later, Saleh Abu Mohsen received a call from a Rafah resident about the location of Asil’s body. He describes what he found when he arrived there:

“Her body was decomposed. There were white maggots coming out of her body and it was swollen. Her legs were swollen and she had blood on her face; it was very difficult. She had a head injury. I couldn’t look at her any more. My brother looked and saw another bullet wound in her chest. She also had shrapnel on her body. I had gone there hoping to find her alive; she had had so many dreams and hopes like any young person her age. She had just finished secondary school and was hoping to apply to university. She could not fulfil her dreams.
<br>
“We took her to the hospital and they prepared her very quickly for burial. We buried her without thinking, as she was, even her mobile and jewellery were buried with her – we had never experienced anything like this before.
<br>
“I could not let the other members of the family see her before the burial even though it is customary to. I did not want them to remember her in her decomposed condition.”

            Given the circumstances of the attacks by Israeli artillery, tanks and aircraft on the morning of 1 August, it is likely that the attack that killed Asil Abu Mohsen was indiscriminate.

Mohammed Abu Duba’s father and brother were killed in a strike on the Mashrou’ Amer area on 2 August. 
                </h4>
                    <p>
Mohammed Khalil Mohammed Abu Duba and his family were trapped in their home on 1 August by heavy Israeli shelling in the area. They escaped the area on the evening of 2 August. When Khalil Abu Duba, Mohammed’s father, and Munir Abu Duba, his brother, drove back home on 2 August to collect the family’s belongings, they were killed by an attack during a larger Israeli offensive on the Mashrou’ Amer area.

Mohammed Abu Duba recounts the conditions in which the family was trapped in their house on 1 August and the intense artillery and air bombardment in their immediate vicinity:

“The F-16 airplanes appeared and hit us with over 15 missiles one after the other with minutes in between. They fell on all the homes around our house… most of them civilian homes with nothing to do with anything. They were random hits. Before this happened, we wanted to leave, we were fed up.”

At approximately 11pm on 1 August, Mohammed Abu Duba heard sounds of tanks clearly, “as if they were next to” his home:

“They struck the house and I no longer saw what was happening... My younger sisters and father and mother were under the stairs in case anything happened. I was on the stairs with my uncle and brother Munir. 
<br>
“The tanks were right next to our demolished house, one side of the tank touching the fallen masonry of our home, and continuing to fire. And another in our street, one behind and one in front of Mashrou’ Amer. There was no way of getting out of the area – impossible… Munir went up to the roof – without of course our father knowing – and he began to count the flags on top of the tanks. They numbered about 37 or more just in… our area… 
<br>
“There was no way of getting out of the area - impossible. Even if we had fled from where we were, we would not have been able to get out of the area because of the drones and bombardments.”

Mohammed Abu Duba recalls that he and his family were too afraid of shelling even to go next door to help a woman they heard screaming. The phone lines were all down, leaving the family isolated. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
On 2 August, about 10 minutes before the sunset prayer, the family decided to escape. Mohammed Abu Duba says:

“We went towards the area around the municipality building. I can’t describe what we saw. It was as unrecognizable as our area. They weren’t our streets. The cemetery is better by a million times than those streets. There were bodies… on the street and there was not enough room in our car to carry them.

Later on 2 August, Mohammed Abu Duba’s father and brother Munir drove back to their destroyed home and retrieved their belongings. They were killed while leaving the area again. Mohammed Abu Duba heard that a Mercedes car had been hit next to the Mashrou’ Amer intersection and was worried because his relatives had been driving in a similar car. He recounts that ambulances could not access the scene, since they required a permit which could take two hours, even if there were injured people at risk of dying imminently. He decided to go to the scene of the attack on foot: 
        </p>
        <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
“I started to look in the shops for Munir. I found their bodies 200m away from the car. There was nobody around. When I found them, there were lots of bodies in front of them… Nobody was responding. I thought perhaps there would be injured. 
<br>
“I rang Munir’s phone and heard it ringing. I said ‘thank God’. It was the ring tone I recognized ringing around me. I looked and saw… he had been thrown onto high voltage wire… If it hadn’t been for his shirt, I wouldn’t have recognized him. I ran to him and pulled him off the wire. He and I both fell to the ground. I looked at him. His face and left hand were all burnt and all his fingers were cut off except for one: his forefinger. I embraced him. I turned off his mobile phone. And carried on holding him. 
<br>
“I wondered where my father was. I looked around and found him strewn about 6m away without a head. I ran to my father but before I got to him I fell, fainted. I tried to reach him but I couldn’t. I called for help but nobody was around. Every time I tried to carry him I fell over. I fell to the floor and lost consciousness. Every time I woke up I saw him and so fainted again.”

            <div class="quote-source">Mohammed Khalil Mohammed Abu Duba</div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Suddenly, he saw his uncle running in the distance towards him:

        <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
“I thought I was dreaming and that none of this had happened. My uncle thought I was injured. When he reached me he saw my father and brother. He screamed and collapsed next to me. The ambulance came to take them and brought them to the Kuwaiti hospital.”

            <div class="quote-source">Mohammed Khalil Mohammed Abu Duba</div>
        </div>
        <p>
It is unclear why Israeli forces attacked the area at the time, since the attack occurred after Lieutenant Hadar Goldin’s death was officially declared. The Israeli army was under an obligation to take all precautions to verify that the car was indeed a military objective, and if in doubt to assume that it was civilian. The attack on the Abu Duba’s car therefore appears to have been undertaken without proper precautions.

At about 10.30 am on 1 August a missile fired from what appeared to be a drone killed a father and his daughter on their way to the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital from their home in eastern Rafah.

Mohammed Baha al-Din al-Gharib, a resident of al-Zuhur district, told Amnesty International that an Israeli air strike killed his father Baha al-Din Kamel al-Gharib and sister Ula. A missile fired by what appeared to be a drone hit them while they were on their way to the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital, says Mohammed Gharib:

“My other sister saw smoke coming from the area they were walking in and came running to tell me. I ran there and found my father thrown to the ground and lying on his back. Ula was on the side. My father had lost his legs and his elbow had been cut off; he had shrapnel in his back, which was also full of holes from the shrapnel. He also had shrapnel in his stomach.

Shirin Arafat was caught in the heavy bombardment of the al-Tannur neighbourhood as a one-tonne bomb struck the Abu Shawareb building on 1 August, killing at least 18 persons, including Shirin’s baby son Mohammed, and wounding dozens more.
                </h4>
                    <p>
Shirin Jamal Arafat and her four children were fleeing through the Mashrou’ Amer area amid heavy bombardment when an attack killed her 55-day-old child, Mohammed, and seriously injured her. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
They had left their home in eastern Rafah at about 10am on 1 August with a large group of other neighbourhood residents who were fleeing their homes on foot. Shirin Arafat recounts that she had left her belongings behind in order to be able to carry her son in her arms while fleeing the area. “We walked a little while and found that the tanks were shooting by the Abu Shawareb [building],” she says. “The first thing was the F-16 shootings, and then came the tanks.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
According to the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, Mohammed Arafat was one of at least 15 civilians who died in an attack by a one-tonne bomb on the Abu Shawareb building between 10.30am and 11am. Accounts of the number of people who may have been on the street at the time of the attack differ, but hundreds of people may have been close to the building when the bomb struck and affected an area of around 100m<sup>2</sup>. Shirin Arafat describes the moment her son died:
                    </p>
                    <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
“I was injured and my son was in my hands. He died in my hands... My son got hit in the head and his face split open. I lost consciousness. Then they moved us to the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital. When they were moving me, they thought I was dead. My face was disfigured.”

        </div>
                        <p>
Shirin Arafat sustained serious injuries in her leg and back, and a shrapnel injury in her head, which the hospitals in Gaza were unable to treat. “After four days they found maggots [in the head wound],” she recounts. “The shrapnel was taken out in the [Gaza] European hospital when they found maggots. And then after 11 days in the European hospital with no luck, they moved me to al-Maqased [hospital in Jerusalem] because I could only breathe with mechanical help.” She underwent treatment and rehabilitation in Jerusalem until late September 2014.
</p>
<p>
The attack on a residential building with a one-ton bomb despite the nearby presence of large numbers of civilians indicates that the Israeli military failed to take adequate, if any, precautions to avoid excessive harm to fleeing civilians. Even if there had been a military target in the building (there is some indication that the Israeli army thought there was a tunnel entrance there), the attack appears to have been grossly disproportionate.

On 1 August 2014 the area around the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital in Rafah was shelled and bombed. Dozens of medical staff, patients and those who had taken refuge in the hospital were wounded and the structure of the hospital was damaged. On the same day three ambulances went to collect wounded people near a mosque in Rafah; one ambulance was hit by what appeared to be three drone-launched missiles and completely destroyed. The three medics and all the wounded within the ambulance were burnt to death. A second ambulance left, while the other, which remained to collect the wounded and dead, was hit by another apparent drone strike.

The Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital, the main hospital serving a population of 350,000 in Rafah, was evacuated on 1 August as shells dropped around it and after evacuation orders from the Israeli military. Amnesty International received accounts of what happened from four different medical staff working at the hospital, including the hospital’s director.

After a truce had been agreed the previous night, people in Rafah began moving outside again on the morning of 1 August, to visit their homes or relatives, or to buy provisions. However, soon after 8.30am, when reports of the capture of an Israeli soldier emerged, the Israeli military began to shell areas of Rafah around where the presumed capture had taken place and shells started striking near the hospital, which was some 800m from the house where captured Israeli soldier Lieutenant Hadar Goldin was thought at one time to have been held.

                    <p>
                        An Amnesty International fieldworker spoke to several members of the hospital staff working in the hospital that day, including Dr Abdullah Ramadan Shehada, the hospital director; Dr Ashraf Mahmoud Hijazi, head of surgery; Dr Youssef Hussein Abed, a surgeon; and Dr Majed Ayesh Abu Taha, a bone specialist. Dr Ashraf Hijazi, who arrived at the hospital at 9am, describes what happened:

“While I was receiving patients I heard bombs dropping outside, which kept getting closer to the hospital. When I came down to the ground floor I saw the hospital was full of people who had escaped the attacks. Doctors were unable to treat patients due to the large influx. The attacks were getting closer; a house 20m from the hospital was targeted.”
            </div>
            <div class="quote-source">Dr Ashraf Hijazi</div>
        </div>
                        <p>
By that time, he says, “many people were coming in and the ambulances were rushing back and forth. The hospital staff were unable to deal with all the cases; some were untreatable. The number of martyrs was huge. We couldn’t count them. Because of the situation in the hospital we had to transfer people because we couldn’t deal with them.” 
</p>
<p>
Dr Abdullah Shehada, the director, who came in after 9am, says: “Every 10 seconds there was an explosion, about eight shells each minute... There were hundreds of injured and dozens of people killed.” The attacks increased in intensity and, around noon, the electricity was cut and the ceiling collapsed.
</p>
<p>
“People from the neighbourhood started to come to the hospital as they thought that the hospital would be a safe place. The hallways were full of people – it was really hard to transfer patients from one section to another,” explains Dr Majed Abu Taha: 
                    </p>
                    <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
    “Most of the injured were children, some less than 12 years old, some between 12 and 16 – the number of kids was huge. Many women too. Most of them were women and kids. Due to the large number of cases, including amputee injuries, we had to transfer them to other hospitals. The surgery room was full and all eight ambulances were out. When we would call another ambulance it would take two hours to arrive at the [Abu Youssef] al-Najjar hospital.”
</div>
            <div class="quote-source">Dr Majed Ayesh Abu Taha</div>
        </div>
                        <p>
Meanwhile, Dr Abdullah Shehada says he kept calling the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) to ask them to tell the Israeli army not to attack. At 1pm, Dr Abdullah received a telephone call from the Israeli army asking him how they could help him. He wanted them to stop the bombardment of the hospital and the person he was speaking to replied: “even if we stopped firing missiles there is something wrong outside the hospital.” 
</p>
<p>
The doctor says: “The attacks are only targeting civilians who came from the eastern area of Rafah to find a safe place.” An hour after the call, at 2pm, the Israeli military stopped firing in the vicinity of the hospital. The Israeli army representative then called the director to tell him that they had stopped firing and Dr Abdullah Shehada requested coordination for the UN or other protected vehicles to transfer the injured and sick to other hospitals.
</p>
<p>
From 2pm to 3pm the situation grew calmer and transfers began to take place. However, after 3pm the shelling intensified again. “It was calmer. We didn’t want to eat as the situation was so horrible, but Dr Youssef Abed brought some food and put it in the office,” Dr Ashraf Hijazi says. He continues:
                    </p>
                    <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
    “I was sitting next to one window, Dr Youssef was sitting next to the other window, and then we heard an explosion next to the southern door. The fire burnt Dr Youssef’s hand and the explosion broke the windows. Dust was everywhere. We thought that the Israelis had attacked the hospital inside and not outside. Fire was inside the hospital. 
<br>
    We went to the reception area and thought that it would be safer than the southern part. The ceiling fell down in some of the patients’ room and then when we arrived at the reception area we found Dr Abdullah trying to call the ICRC and PRCS asking them to send buses to the hospital, but they said that the area was unsafe.”

        </div>
                        <p>
As the attacks become more intense, people started escaping the hospital from the west gate. Dr Majed Abu Taha recounts: 
                    </p>
                    <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
    “At 3.30pm most of the patients started running away from the hospital. They ran by themselves – there were no ambulances to carry them… They were carrying their IV drips and oxygen masks. The hospital was not safe. 
<br>
    Dr Abdullah was calling different authorities, including the Minister of Health and the head of the [Gaza] European hospital to try to get co-ordination for transfers. There was then another call from the Israeli army, which said there was an abducted soldier in the hospital. The director vigorously denied it, saying there were only injured Palestinians and people from the area seeking refuge. 
<br>
    Then the ICRC called saying that co-ordination for ambulances was proving to be impossible and that patients should be transferred using whatever means possible. The patients were transferred, mostly in private cars, to the Kuwaiti hospital – a hospital with only 20 beds and two operating rooms. Meanwhile people were running away, without knowing where to run to as the whole area was unsafe.”

        </div>
                        <p>
The reasons for Israel’s attacks around the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital appear to have been linked to the capture by Hamas of Lieutenant Goldin. Rumours circulating in the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital that a wounded soldier might be in the hospital were also reported by Israeli TV Channel 10. However, even if the Israeli military believed Lieutenant Goldin was in the hospital, the attacks on the hospital and its vicinity were reckless and indiscriminate. International humanitarian law accords protected status to civilian hospitals which must never be the object of attack. Even if a hospital were being misused to commit acts harmful to an attacking party – and there is no indication that this was the case with the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital – according to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the protection enjoyed by the hospital could only cease after due warning and reasonable time for evacuation has been given.
</p>
<p>
Iyad Ali Salama Ghaboun, the owner of a fodder and poultry company whose home is close to the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital, witnessed its evacuation. He recounts that at about 2pm on 1 August, “there was a strike near to our home in empty land”. He says:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “It was a strike from an F-16 airplane. All our windows broke at that moment. I tried to tell the family that it was nothing and we were going to stay…
<br>
“Suddenly, there was noise on the streets. It was between 2.30pm and 3pm. My brother looked out onto the street and came back saying, ‘Quick, the hospital is being evacuated’. I looked at the hospital and will never forget what I saw. People leaving the hospital on hospital beds holding drips, being pushed on carts also holding drips. I saw doctors in hospital clothes carrying white sheets. And people were streaming out. This was in the street. There was a doctor – Ahmed Abu Zakar – he was holding a white screen and making people go down the street next to ours.”
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Iyad Ali Salama Ghaboun</div>
</div>
<p>
Iyad Ghaboun and his family rushed to the car and fled the neighbourhood. “As we were driving away, a missile fell. I thought I had been hit,” he recounts. He said:
                    </p>
                    <div class="quote">
            <div class="quote-text">
    “At the end of Majdi Yunis street, a tuk-tuk [autorickshaw] had been hit next to the al-Khayyat supermarket. I knew that on the tuk-tuk there were seven people and it had been hit by a missile… 
<br>
    As we drove we saw cars – their doors open and engines still running – but not a single person in the street. We went down another street. There was a Vespa [moped] which had been hit. Its two passengers had been hit and parts of their bodies were on the ground still smouldering. And another missile fell in the same street. It was as if they were aiming at me – I don’t know – firing warnings. 
<br>
    There was fear. I had women with me and everyone was crying. The situation was very, very bad. What we saw was not just war; it was like a meat machine making mincemeat from people without mercy.”

                <h4>
At 3.30pm on 1 August a missile apparently fired from a drone struck an ambulance carrying eight people, including three medics, following an attack near al-Birr wa’l-Taqwa Mosque.
                </h4>
                    <p>
According to residents of the area, on 1 August after Friday prayers, at about 1.30pm, the Israeli army, who were shelling extensively in the immediate vicinity, told people to leave Rafah’s Musabbeh neighbourhood. The residents in the area evacuated their homes and most took shelter in the al-Birr wa’l-Taqwa Mosque. 
</p>
<p>
According to an eyewitness watching from the roof of his house, later in the afternoon, around 3.15pm, Suleiman Muhawish al-Hashash came from a dirt road and walked past the mosque looking for a car to take him and his daughter out of the area. A missile apparently fired from a drone hit them and they fell, wounded. Two people from the mosque, Ibrahim and Hazem Mohammed Sheikh al-Eid, ran out at once to help them after a second missile hit them. Then a third missile hit the door of the mosque, injuring Youssef Ahmed Sheikh al-Eid, Du’a Sheikh al-Eid and her three children, all under four years of age.
</p>
<p>
Three ambulances from the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital went to pick up the wounded. The first to arrive was carrying two medics, Atef Zamali and Youssef Sheikh al-Eid, and a young volunteer, Youssef Darabih.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="click" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="  Amnesty International is aware of allegations that the paramedics killed in the strike on the ambulance were members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, based on posters posted on-line that showed them in uniform (see the following archived versions of pages on the website of the al-Quds Brigades, Islamic Jihad's armed wing: <a href='https://goo.gl/5TDcyt' target='_blank'>https://goo.gl/5TDcyt</a>; <a href='https://goo.gl/A4abwO' target='_blank'>https://goo.gl/A4abwO</a>; <a href='http://goo.gl/3Q3NyT' target='_blank'>http://goo.gl/3Q3NyT</a>). Based on information collected by Amnesty International, this was not the case; even if they were affiliated with Islamic Jihad, they were not fighters and were not directly participating in hostilities. At the time they were attacked, they were exclusively performing their duties as paramedics and as such were protected under international humanitarian law from being directly targeted." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> They loaded the wounded from the three strikes into the ambulance and headed back in the direction they had come from. However, about 20m from the mosque, at about 3.30pm, the ambulance was hit by what appears to have been a drone-fired missile. The missile ignited the four oxygen cylinders within the ambulance, burning to death all eight people within it. 
</p>
<p>
The other two ambulances had lost their way and took longer to arrive. When they did, they saw the burning ambulance with the people, including small children, inside it. One of the ambulance drivers recounts that they were about 150m from the burning ambulance when it was attacked again by a missile, so they retreated and tried to take shelter under a tree. The heavy bombing and shelling around them continued.
</p>
<p>
One ambulance turned back towards the hospital; the other drove 150-200m away for fear that its oxygen cylinders would catch fire and stopped. Jaber Darabih, a paramedic from the second ambulance, explains:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “We were notified that they had attacked the mosque in the Musabbeh neighbourhood and then three ambulances headed to the area. I was outside the hospital. The driver of the first ambulance was Atef but I didn’t know who the two medics with him were. I was in the second ambulance and told to go to the attacked mosque. The first ambulance arrived less than 30 minutes before us. My other colleague didn’t know where the attack was exactly. We went to the area and got lost. 
<br>
    When I saw the fire, I didn’t know it was the ambulance. Then when I got closer I realized it was the ambulance that was targeted and that it was full of injured persons – an old man, a woman and three children. 
<br>
    We found a safe place. After that we were attacked next to our ambulance. A missile from a drone landed right next to our ambulance. There were no tanks. It was a missile. There were drones in the area. There was a civilian who we wanted to ask what had happened, when they targeted us and another drone missile landed injuring him in the attack.” 
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Jaber Darabih</div>
</div>
<p>
They came back later that day to examine the ambulance and collect the bodies:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “They had extinguished the fire but the ambulance was already fully burnt – there was nothing left but the metal. This is when we understood that the three ambulance men and the injured people – a woman, two children and an old man – were all inside the ambulance. What we saw was really horrible. The ambulance looked like a tree branch that was completely charred. The bodies had no parts – no legs, no hands – they were severely burnt. So we took them out and put them inside plastic bags and brought them to the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital and put them in the refrigerator.”
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Jaber Darabih</div>
</div>
<p>
It was only then that Jaber Darabih realized that his son [Youssef Darabih, the volunteer] was among the dead:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “My colleague was terrified. He started shouting and crying: ‘Where are the press?’ Then my colleague Shuheib came to me and embraced me and said ‘Youssef, Youssef’. And I said, ‘May his soul rest in peace.’ He said, ‘Youssef, your son, is with them.’ I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know who to mourn, my son or my other two colleagues who were killed. 
<br>
“My colleagues took me to wash my face and we sat in the emergency room. About five to seven minutes later the Israeli army targeted the women’s section of the hospital with three missiles. I was one of the first to go to help transfer the people… I don’t know why they targeted the ambulance. I have been working as a medic for 15 years…  Even if I saw my enemy I would treat them – that is our ethics and our job as medics.” 
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Jaber Darabih</div>
</div>
<p>
In answer to letters written by Amnesty International members to Israeli embassies demanding that Israel fulfil its obligations under the Geneva Conventions to protect hospitals and medical personnel, a spokesman of the Israeli embassy in New Zealand wrote that ambulances in Gaza were frequently used to carry military personnel. The Israeli military has not provided any explanation for why they attacked ambulances in this case. The targeting of ambulances and medical personnel is prohibited under international humanitarian law. </p>

At approximately 1am on 2 August, an air strike destroyed the home of Fuad al-Sha’er, killing nine civilians, including four children.
                </h4>
                    <p>
Yasser Ahmed Younis Abdel-Wahhab, who worked with the Civil Defence as a medical assistance officer in Rafah, told Amnesty International that, after the area experienced heavy shelling on Friday 1 August, he escaped from his home in the al-Jenina district in eastern Rafah with his wife and their children and moved to his brother-in-law’s home in the Bashet camp in the centre of Rafah. “I thought we would go for one night and it would be over by the morning and we could go back home. All the people in the area had left,” he says.
</p>
<p>
That night, he left his wife and children at his brother-in-law’s home and went to his own sister’s house, 50m down the street, because her husband was on ambulance duty:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “My wife had called and left me a message, so I returned her call at 1am, and we chatted for a while about normal things – whether the children had gone to bed, whether they had eaten. She said not to worry about them; they were all fine where they were. All of a sudden, a missile landed on their house and the mobile went dead. I tried calling her back but it did not connect. 
<br>
    I went to the door and there I heard someone outside saying the shelling was on the al-Sha’er home. I tried not to believe this was happening where my children were. I ran and was the first to reach the house.” 
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Yasser Ahmed Younis Abdel-Wahhab</div>
</div>
<p>
The attack had completely destroyed the house. Neighbours came over to help move the rubble. “I became hysterical, so I was taken to the hospital,” he recounts. The next morning, he found out that the attack had killed his wife Nehaya and four of his children: Heitham, 16, Ayman, 14, Lama, 9, and Mohammed, 2. He says:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “The bodies of my children were placed in a vegetable freezer. I cannot describe what it is like to see the bodies of my children in a vegetable freezer. I was able to bury my wife and children after two days. We were frightened to conduct the burial before that date.”
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Yasser Ahmed Younis Abdel-Wahhab</div>
</div>
<p>
Two of Yasser Abdel-Wahhab’s daughters, Lina, 6, and Hala, 11, spent up to seven hours in the rubble before being rescued. Lina sustained shrapnel injuries. Hala suffered a fractured skull and was transferred to Hebron in the West Bank for treatment. 
</p>
<p>
Yasser Abdel-Wahhab’s father-in-law and three brothers-in-law were also killed in the attack: Mohammed Issa Isma’il al-Sha’er, Issa Sa’adi Issa al-Sha’er, Atef Sa’adi Issa al-Sha’er, and Hani Sa’adi Issa al-Sha’er.
</p>
<p>
It is possible that the Israeli military targeted the building where Abdel-Wahhab’s wife and children were killed because, according to a family member, the owner, Fuad al-Sha’er, may have been involved with Palestinian armed groups. Amnesty International was unable to verify this information or to clarify whether Fuad al-Sha’er  was involved in hostilities at the time. In any case, according to Amnesty International’s research, he was not present at the time of the attack. Residents told Amnesty International that he had been away from his home for the majority of the war, but may have been expected to come back after the ceasefire. 
</p>
<p>
If the Israeli military intended to attack Fuad al-Sha’er and believed he was present at the time of the attack, the strike should have been cancelled given the number of civilians present. The attack is likely to have been disproportionate. </p>

At about 3pm on 2 August the Israeli army dropped an aerial bomb on the Abu Taha family home in the al-Shabora camp in Rafah, killing four family members and injuring others. 
                </h4>
                    <p>
At approximately 3.05pm on Saturday 2 August, Israeli warplanes fired at least one missile at a house belonging to Mohammed Ayyad Abu Taha, located in the al-Shabora refugee camp in western Rafah. The attack partially destroyed the house and resulted in the death of Sa’adiya Rizq Abu Taha, Rizq Isma’il Abu Taha, 1, Mohammed Mahmoud Rizq Abdel-Razzaq Abu Taha, 12, and Youssef Mahmoud Rizq Abdel-Razzaq Abu Taha, 10. Three other people who had fled their homes amid the heavy bombardment of the area sustained moderate injuries.
</p>
<p>
Rasha Hassan Hamada Abu Taha, who lived in the al-Salam district, recounts that on 1 August she heard announcements being made by megaphone to residents instructing them to leave their homes and evacuate the area. “Missiles were falling everywhere. We were told to leave the area as it had become a closed military area,” she says. She and their three children moved to her in-laws’ house in al-Shabora refugee camp, which was considered one of the safest areas at the time.
</p>
<p>
Rasha Abu Taha and her family, including her husband, Mohammed Ayyad Abu Taha, who worked for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), spent the night of 1 August with her sister-in-law in al-Salam district. She remembers: 
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “We spent the night there – an awful night. It was like they had stuck us in an area and just pounded us. The following day, Saturday, I found out on the news that our area had become a closed military area and, since I was pregnant, I was afraid to go home and have the road to the [Emirati] hospital cut off.
<br>
    At 2.30pm while preparing lunch, my son Mohammed, 12, was taking pictures of his aunt Sa’adiya telling her ‘I want to send pictures to daddy of what you cooked for us’, and also had his picture taken with her. My other son, Youssef, 10, was sitting at his aunt’s feet and playing with her eight-month-old grandson, Rizq. 
<br>
    The electricity had been cut off and I was sitting near the open door for air. We were all chatting, preparing lunch, taking pictures and suddenly the ceiling fell on us. I thought they were sending a warning missile… I started taking everyone out and managed to take out four of the children – Rizq’s brother Nabil, my daughter Zeinab, 6, Mohammed’s daughter Jana, and Dina, whose mother was injured, reassuring them that it was just a warning shot.”

Rasha Abu Taha describes the immediate aftermath of the attack:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “The young men who had been on the second floor came down and told me to stand aside as I was pregnant and could not keep going back in to take people out – they knew what I would find. I stood there and they came out carrying my son Mohammed dead.
<br>
    I wanted to know what had happened to the rest of my children, whether they were dead or injured. My son Omar was in the basement when he heard the missile and came out running to me. I told him that Mohammed had died and asked him to go find out if Youssef was still alive. The ambulance driver kept telling me to get into the ambulance, but I refused. I stood there holding Omar, waiting for Youssef.”

Rasha Abu Taha’s niece Mona came out of the house bleeding while holding her son to her chest. Mona asked her to hold her son but Rasha was already holding her own son, Omar. Then, Rasha Abu Taha recounts, “Rizq’s [Mona] mother came out screaming: ‘Rizq was in my arms, he flew from my arms’.” She later found out that her older son, Youssef, who had been taking care of Rizq, had also been killed. She says:

“They brought Youssef out on a blanket without a head nor arms, only the lower part of his body. When I saw that Youssef was dead, I accepted to get into the ambulance and went to the Kuwaiti hospital.”

Rasha Abu Taha six-year-old daughter, Zeinab, sustained shrapnel injuries and was taken to the Gaza European hospital. She says:

<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “No one accompanied her, this little girl on her own. She stayed there for three days. The road was closed and I couldn’t ask for her to be brought to us as I feared something would happen to her on the roads. But she spoke to me on the phone.”
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Rasha Hassan Hamada Abu Taha</div>
</div>
<p>
She explains that there were over 25 people in the house at the time of the attack and that around four of them were young men between 17 and 22-years-old who had just come home for lunch. 
</p>
<p>
Amnesty International has no information indicating that any of the men who were in the house were members of a Palestinian armed group. However, even if this was the case and one or more of them were being targeted, the attack appears to have been disproportionate.

                <h4>
Shortly after 11pm on the night of 1 August an Israeli military aircraft dropped a bomb on the home of the Zoroub family in the Saudi residential complex in western Rafah. The attack killed 15 out of the 19 members in the house at the time, and injured the other four. All were civilians.
                </h4>
                    <p>
At around midnight between 1 August and 2 August, an Israeli attack struck the two-storey home of Rafat Oudeh Mohammed Zoroub in the Saudi residential complex in western Rafah. The attack was conducted without prior warning. It killed 15 civilians, including four women and 10 children, and wounded  four girls who were in the building. According to two family members and a neighbour, none of the people in the building was affiliated with any Palestinian armed group. Of the 19 people there, Rafat, an unemployed construction worker, was the only male adult. The blast destroyed the family home and also severely damaged a neighbour’s house, wounding six additional people, the witnesses say.
</p>
<p>
Rafat’s twin 17-year-old daughters, Sheima and Shirin Zoroub, survived. Sheima, who was nine months’ pregnant, said she had come back to her parents’ home for safety, three or four days before the attack:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “At my own house, [an Israeli attack] targeted a neighbour 150m away from us and the whole family died. I was pregnant, and I thought that my parents’ house was safer, and closer to the hospital. My aunts and grandmother came for the same reason – thinking it was safer. On that day, 1 August, my aunts had left our house just before 10am to go back to their homes, but my mum chased them down the street and told them that the truce had been violated and that they were safer at our house.” 
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Sheima Zoroub</div>
</div>
<p>
The attack killed Sheima’s father, Rafat Zoroub, her mother, Sana Namat Zoroub, and her siblings Amir, 15, Oday, 14, Shahed, 10, and Khaled, 9. It killed Sheima’s maternal grandmother, Sabha; her maternal aunt Ahlam, and two of Ahlam’s sons, Rami, 13, and Rawan, 10; another maternal aunt, Su’adand four of Su’ad’s sons, Hamada, 15, Mohammed, 12, Walid, 6, and Mutasim, 3. 
</p>
<p>
The family members had been chatting and watching the news on television when Sheima and Shirin fell asleep at around 10pm. They woke up alone under the rubble after the attack, in darkness, and tried to make their way out of the debris. Sheima recalls:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “I was calling my mum’s name and no one responded. I couldn’t see anything. It was dark and the electricity was off. I didn’t know what to do and was afraid. I was trying to lean on anything just to get a bit of balance but there weren’t any walls. I fell down on my back and it really hurt. When I fell on the ground, I was sure that the baby was dead. [She ended up having a healthy delivery on 5 August.] My head was bleeding and my shoulder was seriously bruised. I had to get stiches and had burns and bruises. I didn’t know that our house had been targeted – I thought it was a neighbour’s house. We had no one from the resistance.”
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Sheima Zoroub</div>
</div>
<p>
Sheima, Shirin and their cousin Ala helped one another crawl out of the rubble. Shirin told Amnesty International:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
“We didn’t know what to do. We were just running and kept falling because there was a lot of stone and glass. People were gathering in front of the school after the bombardment. Someone came and told us that the ambulances were coming so we went there. The ambulance came and there was a man in it with his one-month-old son – the son was dead and the man was crying, we didn’t know who he was. Then they brought in a body with no hands, arms or head. We started screaming and got out of the ambulance. It turned out that the body was one of our family members but we couldn’t recognize him. 
<br>
    Another ambulance came. We got in and we found Saja [a cousin, age 10] inside. They took us to the Emirati hospital. We had no one to be with us because everyone had died, so the hospital contacted someone else from our family and my uncle came and stayed the night. My parents had lived in that house for only a month. And all my siblings are too young to be involved with any [armed groups].” 
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Sheima Zoroub</div>
</div>
<p>
Nihad Jibara Abdullah Zoroub, who lived across the street from the house that was attacked, independently corroborated the accounts of Sheima and Shirin Zoroub. Nihad recalls:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “After the truce was violated earlier that morning, the Israelis banned anyone from moving. We heard this on the radio. It was like a curfew. We didn’t expect [Rafat’s home] to be attacked. They have nothing to do with the resistance and no connections to anyone [political]. 
<br>
    Fifteen minutes before the attack, we were trying to go to sleep. The blast forced our door closed, we were locked in. We couldn’t get out of the house. We were banging on the door and screaming, until the neighbours came and forced it open for us. It took three days to find all the bodies. The decomposing body of Su’ad’s son was found on the roof of the neighbouring house.” 
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Nihad Jibara Abdullah Zoroub</div>
</div>
<p>
According to Nihad Zoroub and Shirin Zoroub, the blast from the attack also wounded at least six members of the Abu Mohsen family, one of whom was transferred to Turkey for medical treatment, and badly damaged their home, about 30m away from Rafat Zoroub’s home. 
</p>
<p>
Amnesty International has been unable to identify any potential target or reason for the attack on the Zoroub family home. Even if there had been a military target nearby, the attack appears to have been disproportionate or otherwise indiscriminate.</p>

                <h4>
At approximately 3am on the night between 1 and 2 August, the Israeli army dropped a bomb on four adjacent homes in al-Shabora camp killing eight civilians, including six children.
                </h4>
                    <p>
An Israeli attack in Rafah after 3am on 2 August killed eight members of three different families: six children, a woman and a man. The munition destroyed a group of four adjoining makeshift houses, where 26 people lived, according to witnesses who survived the attack. They say that none of the residents were members of armed groups.
</p>
<p>
The attack killed Arwa Mahmoud Neireb and her daughters Ala, 5, and Ibtisam, 12, and fatally wounded a third daughter, Doha, 15, who died of a head wound later that day. It also killed Ibrahim, 10, Ahmed, 7, and Anas, 5, three brothers from the Abu Ayta family next door to the Neireb home, as well as Ibrahim Manyarawi, a man whose home was nearby.
</p>
<p>
Fathi Ibrahim Suleiman Abu Ayta, an English teacher, and his wife Abir, survived the attack that killed three of their sons. Abir says families in the area received automated calls on their mobiles and landlines on the afternoon of 1 August: 
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “They were saying, ‘The Israel Defense Forces are warning you not to go outside your houses or move from one place to another, unless you want to put yourself in danger – you’ve been warned’. So they tell us not to go out and then they destroy our house on top of us. The kids always wanted us to leave; they were afraid that the surrounding houses might be targeted and ours would be destroyed given that it was made of asbestos.”
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Abir Abu Ayta</div>
</div>
<p>
Assam Mohammed Abed Rabbo Neireb was awoken at about 2.45am. The missile hit the wall between their house and that of Fathi Abu Ayta. Arwa Mahmoud Ahmed Neireb and her daughters, Ibtisam Bassam Mohammed Neireb, 12, Doha, 15, and Ula, 5, were all killed as a result of the attack. Ibtisam’s body was found in the rubble five days later and Doha had been thrown onto the roof of a concrete house.
</p>
<p>
Fathi Abu Ayta and his wife Abir said they were watching the news in their bedroom at about 3am on 2 August when the attack struck. They initially assumed that someone else’s house had been targeted, not their own, because they had no connection to Palestinian armed groups. The attack “turned everything upside down. We were under the rubble. I didn’t know what was actually targeted then. We were all injured and I couldn’t see anything.” Neighbours dug out the family, he says. A neighbour, Raja Fathi Suleiman al-Ghoul told Amnesty International that she “found Fathi and his wife in our house” after the blast. 
</p>
<p>
Fathi only learned that his sons were dead after he arrived at the Kuwaiti hospital. The hospital, overwhelmed with casualties, lacked space for them. “Ahmed’s body was shredded into pieces. He was in an ice-cream fridge for two days, then moved to the vegetable fridge,” his father says.
</p>
<p>
Ahmed’s mother, Abir, remembers what happened to her children when “the walls came down”:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “Dina was in the kitchen making a sandwich – the whole kitchen fell on her. Lina was asleep in her room and suffocating after the attack. Ahmed was asleep; he was cut into two halves. We only had one half; the other was buried with the neighbours. We put him in a bag and buried him in the Tall al-Sultan cemetery. Ibrahim’s head was cut open and his brain was coming out. Mohammed must have died by suffocating, as his body seemed fine except shrapnel wounds on his face and blood on his teeth.” 
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Abir Abu Ayta</div>
</div>
<p>
The Abu Ayta family’s neighbour, Bassam Mohammed Abed Rabbo Neireb, an employee of the Palestinian authorities, said that 11 people were in his house at the time of the attack, including his sister, his wife and their eight children, four of them adults, four of them minors. 
</p>
<p>
Bassam Neireb describes intense Israeli bombardment earlier on 1 August, which “trapped the people who went back home to the eastern part” during a temporary ceasefire: 
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “They were shelling al-Balbisi street, so the people there had no choice: if they went forward, they died. So they had to stay in their homes, trapped, waiting to also be bombed. We heard on the radio and TV that the Israelis were saying that it was a curfew and no one should move – everything that moved would be a target.”
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Bassam Mohammed Abed Rabbo Neireb</div>
</div>
<p>
The explosion killed his wife, Arwa, daughters Ala, 5, and Ibtisam, 12; it also propelled two other children into a neighbour’s home, and another child onto the roof of another neighbour’s home. The dead were so disfigured that the family collected the body parts and buried them, and mistakenly assumed they had buried Ibtisam’s remains, whose body was found four days later. Another daughter, Doha, flew 10m away in the blast. She was taken first to the Kuwaiti hospital, which lacked equipment needed to treat her head wound, and waited two hours before Israeli forces granted approval to the ICRC to transfer her to a hospital in Khan Yunis, where she died, her father says. 
</p>
<p>
The survivors were subjected to appalling hospital conditions and a hasty funeral for their loved ones, Bassam Neireb explains: 
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “The dead bodies were piled up in one small room and they had a fan in that room, that’s it. My little girl was in an ice-cream fridge. Then a big truck came and took the dead bodies and put them in a big vegetable fridge somewhere else. Then they were buried. That happened without a funeral. No funeral, no rituals whatsoever. We didn’t even have a chance to say goodbye. I am always thinking that I really miss them and I want to go to their graves and dig them out to see them.”
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Bassam Mohammed Abed Rabbo Neireb</div>
</div>
<p>
Raja al-Ghoul, a neighbour, says the attack wounded her husband, Emad, (who managed a taxi office), and their five children, all aged under 10. 
</p>
<p>
The four family homes were located in the al-Shabora camp in western Rafah, which had not been affected on 1 August and was therefore considered safe, resulting in a number of families moving there that day. By the evening of 1 August, the firepower used in the east of Rafah had moved westwards and residents reported hearing a swath of continuous explosions.
</p>
<p>
Amnesty International has not been able to determine what may have been the intended target of this attack. Those killed and injured were civilians and there was no fighting in the vicinity at the time of the attack.</p>

                <h4>
At approximately 3.30am, on 2 August an Israeli aircraft conducted an air strike on the home of the Abu Suleiman family killing nine people, five of them children.
                </h4>
                    <p>
At around 3.30am on 2 August, an Israeli attack struck a two-storey residential building in Rafah without warning. The attack killed nine people: seven members of the Abu Suleiman family – five children and two women – and two neighbours, five witnesses told Amnesty International. 
</p>
<p>
Rami Abu Suleiman, who lived in an apartment on the second floor, recalls the attack:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “We were watching the news and the kids were asleep, and around 12am they targeted a house nearby. I was following the news and people were calling to check on us. At 2am there was another strong explosion. I was comforting my wife and told her not to worry – there is no way we could be targeted. I was lying down on the bed and she was on the computer. At 3.30am, they targeted our house. I found myself and the mattress I was lying on outside the house with the rubble on top of me. I couldn’t believe I was still breathing.” 
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Rami Abu Suleiman</div>
</div>
<p>
The attack killed Rami Abu Suleiman’s wife, Heba, their sons Mohammed, 11, and Ahmed, 2; and their twin three-year-old girls, Lama and Jana.
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “I found my wife at the neighbours’. The rubble was all over her. She went through three walls. I held her head, but she couldn’t breathe. I asked her to say the final prayers, but she couldn’t. People came to help me get her out and they took her to the hospital, but she was dying. We found Mohammed’s body in pieces. 
<br>
    Around 4.30am or 5am, there was daylight and we were able to see and friends and neighbours who came to search for the bodies – they found Jana at one of the neighbours’. Another neighbour found Lama next to the washing machine. Ahmed’s body seemed fine but the back of his head was gone. There was no warning, no call – nothing. Some people were wanted by Israel in our neighbourhood – they got warnings to evacuate their homes – but we didn’t.”
<br>
Rami’s brother, Ramzi, who also lived in the building, says the attack killed his wife, Feda, and wounded their one-month-old daughter, Mayar, and four other children. Tuhfa Abu Suleiman, the men’s mother, says the blast blew Feda “17m from the blast site, and we found parts of her scattered on the neighbours’ rooftops.” 
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Rami Abu Suleiman</div>
</div>
<p>
The attack killed Rana, the 10-year-old daughter of a third brother, Ra’ed, a baker, who said he “woke up in the street under a tree with rubble on top of me” after the explosion. He then returned home and found that Rana had been killed, and that his other children were “injured and full of blood”:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “My son Ahmed was alive; his brother brought him out of the rubble. My one-year-old [son] was lucky because the bedroom furniture fell on top of him at an angle that protected him. I heard my daughter screaming but I was injured and couldn’t help her. [Surgeons at Nasser hospital operated on Ra’ed the following day due to a chest wound and a dislocated left shoulder.] 
<br>
    The neighbours helped us. Then the ICRC got co-ordination and took my son Mohammed and daughter Maha to Nasser hospital [in Khan Yunis]. Maha had fractures all over.” 
</div>
<div class="quote-source">Rami Abu Suleiman</div>
</div>
<p>
The attack killed two neighbours from different families: Abir Abu Arab, in her 40s, and Miryam Abu Jazar, an elderly woman who had come to stay with a relative in the area after having left her house in eastern Rafah for safety, survivors say.
</p>
<p>
All witnesses who spoke to Amnesty International say that no one in the building at the time of the attack was a member of an armed group. The Israeli army’s intended target in this attack remains unclear. Even if there had been a military target nearby, the attack appears to have been disproportionate.
