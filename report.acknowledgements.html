            <p>The report was based on extensive fieldwork in Italy. The authors thank the numerous actors who accepted to share their experience with us. Our gratitude goes in the first instance to the survivors of the different cases we investigated. Without their trust, this report would not be possible. We further thank the state actors who granted us interviews (Coast Guard, Customs Police, Frontex, Public prosecutors). While we are critical of the policy decisions taken by Frontex, we thank the Frontex Press office and it&rsquo;s Public Access to Documents sections which accepted to share a considerable amount of documents towards our research.</p>

            <p>The production of this report has necessitated that we consult with experts who generously shared their knowledge with us and helped us sharpen our analysis. Our gratitude goes to:</p>

            <p>Legal experts: Itamar Mann, Claire Saas, Karine Parrot, Jean Matringe, Fulvio Vassallo Paleologo, Carmen Cordaro</p>

            <p>Policy experts: Leonhard den Hertog, Ferruccio Pastore, Jeff Crisp, Tuesday Reitano, Julien Jeandesboz, Chris Jones, Marie Martin</p>

            <p>Statistics experts: Patrick Ball, Tamara Last, Manuela Honegger-Heller, Gian-Andrea Monsch</p>

            <p>Over the years, we have benefited from the insights of numerous NGOs, and their contribution was fundamental to the understanding of the situation at the maritime frontiers of the EU. We thank in particular the WatchTheMed, Migreurop, Boats4People and EuroMed Rights networks, as well as Statewatch, Amnesty International, ARCI, and Meltingpot.</p>
