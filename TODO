Carousel double image - get arrow to show up

 on the video displayed in the exec summary, which is from my Plus, there is a lot of unecessry display...
you might just want to try uploading this, to show us how it looks.
https://vimeo.com/162952750
we'll need it somewhere in the exec summary too
but don't worry about this. if i have too, i'll upgrade to Pro.


Lorenzo report:

- videos can be played fullscreen, only vimeo PRO accounts can customise their player to remove share buttons and `Vimeo' logo - does Charles have PRO account?
- double image is up - need to figure out why arrow won't show up tbc...
- https://www.publitas.com/features/ could be an option for embedding pdfs into the site
