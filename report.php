    On 1 August 2014 Israel and Hamas agreed to a 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire that would take effect at 8am that day.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="All times mentioned in the report are given according to the local time in the Gaza Strip during the period of the conflict (GMT+2)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Four weeks after Israel launched a military offensive on Gaza, thousands of Palestinians who had sought refuge in makeshift shelters or with relatives prepared to return to their homes during the anticipated break in hostilities. 
</p>
<p>
In Rafah, the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip, a group of Israeli soldiers patrolling an agricultural area west of the border encountered a group of Hamas fighters posted there. A fire fight ensued, resulting in the death of two Israeli soldiers and one Palestinian fighter. The Hamas unit captured an Israeli officer, Lieutenant Hadar Goldin, and took him into a tunnel. What followed became one of the deadliest Israeli attacks during the war; an intensive use of firepower, which lasted four days and killed scores of civilians (reports range from at least 135 to over 200), injured many more and destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes and other civilian structures, mostly on 1 August.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="According to the UN Protection Cluster, “100 fatalities were recorded in Rafah on 1 August 2014, including 75 civilians (24 children and 18 women)”, as cited by the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict, 24 June 2015, <a href='http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIGazaConflict/Pages/ReportCoIGaza.aspx#report' target='_blank'>http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIGazaConflict/Pages/ReportCoIGaza.aspx#report</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015).

These figures indicate that at least 135 civilians were killed between 1 and 3 August. The Joint Documentation Unit of Palestinian human rights NGOs in Gaza calculated that a total of 202 civilians were killed during the same period, including some who died later of injuries sustained during those days; the Unit breaks the total down into 108 civilians (38 children, 26 women and 44 men) killed on 1 August, 55 civilians (25 children, nine women and 21 men) killed on 2 August and 39 civilians (10 children, eight women and 21 men) killed on 3 August." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

    About the Report
</span></div></div>
<p>
    In this report, Amnesty International and Forensic Architecture, a research team based at Goldsmiths, University of London, provide a detailed reconstruction of the events in Rafah from 1 August until 4 August 2014, when Israeli ground forces retreated to Gaza’s borders, although the conflict lasted for three more weeks. The report exposes the Israeli army’s response to the capture of Lieutenant Hadar Goldin and its implementation of the Hannibal Directive – a controversial command designed to deal with captures of soldiers by unleashing massive fire on persons, vehicles and buildings in the vicinity of the attack, despite the risk to civilians and the captured soldier. 
</p> 
<p>
    The report recounts events by connecting various forms of information including: testimonies from victims and witnesses including medics, journalists, and human rights defenders in Rafah; reports by human rights and other organizations; news and media feeds; public statements and other information from Israeli and Palestinian official sources; and videos and photographs collected on the ground and from the media. The events are presented in the time and space in which they took place. 
</p>
<p>
    The main narrative of the report includes links to detailed case studies that describe individual incidents in which civilians were killed or injured and include testimonies collected by Amnesty International fieldworkers during the conflict or shortly afterwards, in August or September 2014 (one case study, that of the Abu Suleiman family, includes extracts from testimonies provided to the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights during the conflict). The case studies also include analysis of how the actions of the Israeli military violated international humanitarian law (the laws of war). The report presents relevant provisions of international law and analyses the adequacy or otherwise of the Israeli investigations carried out to date into the events of 1-4 August 2014. In addition, the report includes a detailed methodology section and a background section that sets out the context of the events in Rafah, namely the overall conflict of July-August 2014 and patterns of violations on both sides, as well as a brief history of the Hannibal Directive. Finally, on the basis of the information and analysis presented in the report as a whole, the report sets out conclusions on the extent to which the attacks of 1-4 August 2014 violated international humanitarian law and might amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as proposing recommendations for how justice can be achieved for victims and how such violations can be avoided in the future.

    According to the report of the Givati Brigade inquiry, commissioned by the Israel army to draw lessons from the military operation in Rafah, parts of which were made public,<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Israeli army Radio (Galei Tzahal), “Exclusive: New Details about the Rafah Battle” (in Hebrew), 14 April 2015, <a href='http://glz.co.il/1138-61304-he/Galatz.aspx' target='_blank'>http://glz.co.il/1138-61304-he/Galatz.aspx</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Colonel Winter ordered his forces to surround and isolate the possible tunnel area until 8am when the ceasefire was to come into effect. According to Colonel Winter, the intention was to create a line further into the Gaza Strip within which the Israeli army could continue searching for tunnels. Colonel Winter described this military manoeuvre to the Givati Brigade inquiry as “confusing” since it led to a situation whereby a tunnel harbouring Palestinian fighters existed within the area surrounded by the Israeli army during the ceasefire.

In a testimony given to Breaking the Silence, a junior infantry field officer who took part in the incursion describes his experience: 
    <div class="quote">
        <div class="quote-text">
            “The incursion occurred the night before the ceasefire. The entrance happened at midnight, and everyone knew that at 8am the next morning it would be over. We entered the area in order to destroy the entire tunneling infrastructure that still remains there. If you think about it, that really means every house and agricultural structure in the area. There was pressure to go in and finish the job very quickly.

    The Givati Brigade inquiry timed the beginning of the firefight at 9.06am. From traces found on site, presumably gun cartridges and footprints, it concluded that the Hamas unit was comprised of five or six members. The inquiry concluded that Lieutenant Goldin was taken into the tunnel less than one minute after the fire fight began.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Yohai Ofer, “Army assessed that Goldin alive and taken to hospital” (in Hebrew), NRG, 14 April 2014, <a href='http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/688/909.html;' target='_blank'>http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/688/909.html</a>; Gili Cohen, “Givati inquiry into the battle in Rafah: Fire was disproportionate, but soldiers were not properly secured in the area” (in Hebrew), <i>Haaretz<i>, 14 April 2014, <a href='http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/1.2613390' target='_blank'>http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/1.2613390</a> (both last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> When the soldiers from the outflanking unit and others arrived at the scene they found three bodies on the ground and initially believed them to be the bodies of the three Israeli soldiers.

    Because no one saw Lieutenant Goldin dragged into the tunnel, all commanders in the area were ordered to count their soldiers. According to the Israeli army, at 9.36am, after confirming that Lieutenant Goldin was indeed missing, Colonel Winter announced the implementation of the Hannibal Directive over the radio, thus unleashing the operational directive that would determine the events of the days that followed.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="AP, “Israeli fire on Gaza town raises war crimes claim”, 31 August 2014, in <i>Daily Mail</i>, <a href='http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2739001/Israeli-fire-Gaza-town-raises-war-crimes-claim.html' target='_blank'>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-2739001/Israeli-fire-Gaza-town-raises-war-crimes-claim.html</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> At 9.46am, according to the Israeli army, the bombardment of Rafah began.

    Around the same time, members of the al-Namla family left their home in the al-Tannur neighbourhood when they heard the bombing. Israeli army shelling of the area killed Ala Jamal al-Namla and her children Youssef and Nagham just outside their home.

    During the initial phase of the attack the Israeli army appeared to fire at moving vehicles without distinction, including at <a href="#" class="testimony" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Musabbeh">ambulances</a> heading to the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital.

<div class="h3-block"><p>
    At 9.54am Lieutenant Eitan Fund, an officer in the reconnaissance unit and a close friend of Lieutenant Goldin, received Colonel Winter’s permission to enter the tunnel. Colonel Winter reportedly asked him “to throw in a grenade” before going in, regardless of the possibility that it might harm Lieutenant Goldin.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Amos Harel and Gili Cohen, “What happened in Gaza’s Rafah on ‘Black Friday’?”, <i>Haaretz<i>, 8 August 2014, <a href='http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.609533' target='_blank'>http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.609533</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Lieutenant Fund entered, with a hand pistol only. Three soldiers followed him, carrying torches and shooting continuously as they moved through the tunnel. Lieutenant Fund lost his hearing. The tunnel, he said, was 1.9m high, made of concrete with electrical wires running along the walls. The soldiers noticed a trail of blood after 200m. They continued to fire shots. In a media interview Lieutenant Fund said: “I instructed the soldier next to me to open fire if he identified any figures – even if it meant killing or wounding Hadar [Goldin]. Painful as it is, it is preferable that way.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Interview with Lieutenant Fund in Ilana Dayan, “From deep under” (in Hebrew), Uvda (a documentary series of Mako.co.il), 19 April 2015, <a href='http://www.mako.co.il/mako-vod-keshet/uvda#/mako-vod-keshet/uvda-2015/VOD-eaea8aa6a91dc41006.htm?sCh=440c3cc15d499410&pId=957463908' target='_blank'>http://www.mako.co.il/mako-vod-keshet/uvda#/mako-vod-keshet/uvda-2015/VOD-eaea8aa6a91dc41006.htm?sCh=440c3cc15d499410&pId=957463908</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015) (“From deep under”, Uvda)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> This confirms that Lieutenant Fund, like other soldiers, understood that Lieutenant Goldin’s death was preferable to letting Hamas capture him alive, according to their understanding of the Hannibal Directive. 
</p>
<p>
    After 300 or 400m, according to Lieutenant Fund, the tunnel split. Here they found some of Lieutenant Goldin’s clothing and his personal equipment. The right turn was closed off with a blanket hiding a pile of military bags with battle equipment, guns, explosives, food and water. Lieutenant Fund and another soldier ran for a couple of minutes, following the trail of blood. Their radio did not work and they feared being taken prisoners themselves. They turned around and ran back. Shortly afterwards another group of soldiers was sent into the tunnel to call them out.
</p>
<p>
    The soldiers left the tunnel at about 10.30am. Once above ground, Lieutenant Fund and the soldiers joined the rest of the troops as they prepared for an incursion towards the area they believed the tunnel led to. According to the Givati Brigade inquiry the ground incursion began at 10.40am. At around 12pm, Lieutenant Fund received orders to return to the tunnel entrance and lead a group of specialized soldiers from the “Unit for the identification of missing people” and commandos. They were to retrieve the rest of Lieutenant Goldin’s remains to assess his condition. They found several items belonging to Lieutenant Goldin, including personal items and blood-stained pieces from his uniform. Based on these items, the Israeli army’s forensic unit assessed that Lieutenant Goldin could not have survived his wounds. The following night the chief military rabbi signed Lieutenant Goldin’s death certificate and cleared the way for a funeral to take place on Sunday 3 August.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Walla, “War in the South Updates: 25th Day” (in Hebrew), 2 August 2014, <a href='http://news.walla.co.il/item/2771294' target='_blank'>http://news.walla.co.il/item/2771294</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> By that time most of the Israeli army units had retreated from Rafah and the rest of the Gaza Strip.
</p>
<p>
    Another Givati Brigade officer who participated in the battle explains the logic of the operation: “In such an event you prefer a killed soldier rather than a soldier in enemy hands, like [Gilad] Shalit. I told myself ‘even if I bring back a corpse I have brought back the missing person’. You do everything possible not to put an entire state in a Gilad Shalit whirlwind.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Yoav Zitun, “Givati commanders who fought in Rafah: Clear conscience” (in Hebrew), 24 September 2014, Ynet, <a href='http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4568410,00.html' target='_blank'>http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4568410,00.html</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

    Attacking the Tunnels

<div class="box" style="margin-top:0rem;"><h5>
Amnesty International and Forensic Architecture cross-referenced various sources to reconstruct what the Israeli army stated were attacks on the Palestinian armed groups’ tunnel system. Based on this analysis, it appears that during the enactment of the Hannibal Directive the Israeli military targeted some locations where it thought Lieutenant Goldin might be. 
</h5></div>
<p>
    The analysis is based upon the following sources:
<ol><li>
    A high-resolution satellite image taken at 11.54am on 14 August shows traces of deep mechanical excavations – where the Israeli army dug for tunnels – in various places north and south of Salah al-Din Street.

    Timing and Locating the Strikes
</span></div></div>
<p>
    The earliest photographs of the strikes on 1 August that Amnesty International and Forensic Architecture have obtained were taken at 10.22am, and show the dust raised by artillery fire at the Abu Youssef al-Najjar roundabout, while at about 10.49am they feature the first bombs dropped from the air. Journalists, photographers, human rights activists and citizens with cameras took photographs of the carnage on the streets. Several photographers were taking pictures from the Smart Media Center on the eighth floor of the Masri Towers, from where the entire city is visible. 
</p>
<p id="geosyncing">
    The pictures from the rooftops are characteristic photojournalistic representations of a city under fire. The photographic frame is horizontally divided between the cityscape and the sky, linked by smoke plumes generated from artillery and air force bombing. Using these photographs, Forensic Architecture identified, located and timed each of the large smoke plumes generated by aerial bombs.
</p>
<p>
    The photographs confirm fire burning and heavy aerial bombardment on the area possible of harbouring the tunnel entrances, from 10.49am. This timeline aligns with the Israeli air force evacuating its soldiers from the tunnel at 10.30am, clearing the way for the tunnels to be bombed by the air force.

</span>
</div>
<p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
    Photographs of smoke plumes taken from 10.49am onwards allowed Forensic Architecture to determine the locations of heavy bombing. The area most heavily bombed is where traces of excavations can be seen on the ground. These excavations were undertaken from the afternoon of 1 August until 3 August. This demonstrates that the Israeli army bombed the very places where it later excavated for the tunnel network.
</p>
<p>
    The size of the plumes and the craters indicates that the aerial strikes included the use of one-tonne bombs, likely to be MK-84/GBU-31 bombs, according to a military analyst commissioned by Amnesty International. The analyst confirmed that if half-tonne or one-tonne bombs were to land in close proximity to a tunnel entrance they would have created a blast of extreme heat and a shock wave strong enough for the tunnel to collapse, killing those inside it. 
</p>
<p>
    Eli Gino, Colonel Winter’s deputy, explains: “We knew that bombing the tunnel mouths by plane would reduce the chances of finding Lieutenant Goldin alive… but this was the best way to deal with the situation.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Yoav Zitun, “Givati commanders who fought in Rafah: Clear conscience” (in Hebrew), 24 September 2014, Ynet, <a href='http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4568410,00.html' target='_blank'>http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4568410,00.html</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> “The bottom-line”, another Givati Brigade commander said weeks after the end of the war, “is that Lieutenant Goldin is not with them [Palestinian fighters] and the Hamas unit is probably exterminated.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Yoav Zitun, “Givati commanders who fought in Rafah: Clear conscience” (in Hebrew), 24 September 2014, Ynet, <a href='http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4568410,00.html' target='_blank'>http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4568410,00.html</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

    Mapping the Tunnel

<p>
    According to the Givati Brigade inquiry the entire incursion into the tunnel lasted slightly over 30 minutes. By Forensic Architecture’s calculations, Lieutenant Fund and his team covered about 800m of tunnel. Lieutenant Fund’s testimony, together with traces of excavation seen in the satellite image of 14 August, allowed Forensic Architecture to reconstruct the path of the tunnel as the Israeli army thought it to be. The tunnel has since been destroyed but, as this report will later demonstrate, the Israeli air force bombed the tunnel in the very places it thought its captured soldier might have been located.

    THE BOMBING OF AL-TANNUR
</span></div></div>
<p>
    Many Palestinians died during the manhunt in which the Israeli army directed intense and indiscriminate firepower at populated residential neighbourhoods in eastern Rafah. Not all attacks were conducted at calculated locations, but at least two attacks using large aerial bombs appear to have been directed at locations where the Israeli army possible Lieutenant Goldin to be.
</p>
<p id="shadow-analysis">
    The single most deadly strike of this day occurred at 10.53am when two one-tonne bombs were dropped on a residential area in the al-Tannur neighbourhood of eastern Rafah. Several buildings were completely destroyed and many others at least partially damaged. The buildings were largely empty but at least 16 people died on the streets while trying to flee the area. 
</p>
<p>
    A video clip shot from a rooftop in Rafah shows two large bombs striking a dense residential area. Towards the end of the clip, the videographer enlargements out briefly and captures two columns casting a clear shadow on the roof terrace. Using these columns as sundials Forensic Architecture determined the strike took place at 10.53am, and corroborated this time by synching the video clip with other photographs and videos.

<p style="margin-top:1.5rem;" id="plume-analysis">
By analysing the same smoke plume as seen from different perspectives, Forensic Architecture located the strike site near the intersection of Oruba Street and al-Balbisi Street, next to the Abu Shawareb building, in eastern Rafah. The site is a few hundred metres west of the western-most area captured by Israeli army ground forces in their 1-4 August incursion. Two frames within the video capture the actual bombs in mid-fall.</p>

</div>
<p style="margin-top:1.5rem;" id="tannur-bombing">
    Having previously established the distance of the videographer from the bombed site, Forensic Architecture measured the bombs and deemed them to be consistent with MK-84/GBU-31 bombs, the largest and most destructive guided bombs of their kind, each packed with one tonne of explosives, a conclusion corroborated by the analysis of military experts. The two bombs fell on a small single story structure – the house of Abdel-Raouf Mohammed Fahajan, who was not at the premises at the time. That structure and the Abu Shawareb building nearby collapsed; both appear to have been uninhabited at the time of the attack. However, at least 16 people who had fled their homes and were on Oruba Street and al-Balbisi Street were killed in the attack, and many others were injured. Scores of people were on the streets attempting to flee the area in close vicinity to the site of the attack.

    AL-TANNUR: A MANHUNT?
</span></div></div>
<p>
<p>
    Several reasons lead Forensic Architecture to believe that the Israeli army possible the area of harbouring a tunnel mouth and thus bombed it to target the captured soldier and his captors: 
</p>
<ol><li>
    The strike targeted a small single-story structure with a one-tonne bomb (one of the largest bombs in the Israeli air force arsenal).
</li>
<li>
    According to the military analyst commissioned by Amnesty International to examine photographs of the site, the ammunition is a one-tonne bomb with a delay fuse. This ammunition allows the bomb to blast underground – pointing to an air force trying to target an underground structure. 
</li>
<li>
    The site was struck at the same time as other tunnel entrances in the east of Rafah were struck, likely pointing to the same air force mission.
</li>
<li>
    The site is located on a line connecting sites that were subsequently excavated by the Israeli army searching for tunnels (visible on the 14 August satellite image).

    The al-Tannur bombing was the single most deadly incident between 1 and 4 August. The casualties all occurred in the streets, with families fleeing artillery, helicopter and drone fire. The destruction radius of the bomb was 100m, with an approximate impact area (where casualties could be sustained) of 17,500m2 according to Forensic Architecture.

    Mass Destruction

    The Israeli army apparently intended to surround and isolate the Tabet Zare’ neighbourhood north of Salah al-Din Street. Tank commanders were given permission to shoot at “suspicious points” – buildings, people or vehicles – without warning. What constituted a “suspicious point” was left to the discretion of the commanders, and soldiers interpreted it as any building close to the tanks or overlooking them, “almost every object or structure within the forces’ eyeshot had the potential to be considered suspicious and thus targeted,” states the introduction to the Breaking the Silence compilation of testimonies.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Breaking the Silence, <i>This is How We Fought in Gaza</i>, Introduction, p. 18." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    The D9 bulldozers moved first, uprooting trees, removing small structures and piling earth mounds to mask the movement of infantry soldiers. An officer described this movement to Breaking the Silence:
</p>
<div class="quote">
    <div class="quote-text">
        “A crazy amount of artillery was fired… armoured D9 bulldozers plowed the entire area. After them came the tanks in two lines, continuously shooting at houses as they moved along.

</p>
    <p>
        There were tank tracks through the small fields and orchards surrounding homes in this semi-agrarian area. Tanks avoided the roads, fearing they might be booby-trapped. The same officer quoted above also said: “There are also agricultural fields there, the D9 [bulldozer] rips them all up. And tin sheds. It takes down whatever’s in its way, it topples greenhouses.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Breaking the Silence, <i>This is How We Fought in Gaza: Soldiers’ testimonies and photographs from Operation “Protective Edge” (2014)</i>, Tel Aviv, 2015, <a href='http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf' target='_blank'>http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015), testimony 30, pp. 82-84." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

        A tank commander described to Breaking the Silence how he used the manoeuvre through the semi-agrarian area as a training opportunity:
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
        <div class="quote-text">
            “I assigned one of my company commanders to document some of this [the manoeuvre] by video, so we could illustrate it in training – showing soldiers for example how a tank drives through a grove of trees or shoots in different situations.

        Dolev Ohayon, a Givati Brigade soldier who participated in the ground assault, describes the situation in a diary he kept throughout the war: “The air force, tanks, artillery, engineering, machine guns, all the Israeli army fire power was there.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Walla, “I must take the thoughts of dying out of my head” (in Hebrew), 23 April 2015, <a href='http://news.walla.co.il/item/2847705' target='_blank'>http://news.walla.co.il/item/2847705</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015).

Salah al-Din Street was the deepest point the Israeli army’s ground incursion had reached into the Rafah area during the war. Dolev Ohayon’s unit dismounted the armoured vehicles and crossed Salah al-Din Street on foot to search buildings.

        Dolev Ohayon and other soldiers who recounted their experience to Breaking the Silence or the media (after Israeli army’s censorship) all describe the same process by which houses were captured. First, a tank would fire a shell at the building, then covered by the tank’s machine-gun fire, soldiers would approach the building. Soldiers might fire a portable anti-tank and rockets at one of the ground-level walls to produce a large hole. They would then enter the house through this hole and throw in grenades before entering a room, regardless of whether or not there were civilians inside.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Walla, “I must take the thoughts of dying out of my head” (in Hebrew), 23 April 2015, <a href='http://news.walla.co.il/item/2847705' target='_blank'>http://news.walla.co.il/item/2847705</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015).

</p>
<div class="quote">
    <div class="quote-text">
        “We were at home [in the Mashrou’ Amer area] on Friday, before the sunset call to prayer [about 7.30pm]. The F-16 airplanes appeared and hit us with over 15 missiles one after the other with minutes in between. They fell on all the homes around our house… most of them civilian homes with nothing to do with anything. They were random hits… 
    .         “At 11pm we began to hear sounds of tanks clearly as if they were next to our home. From far away, approaching. They struck the house and I no longer saw what was happening as we hid under the stairs… The tanks were right next to our demolished house, one side of the tank touching the fallen masonry of our home, and continuing to bombard. And another in our street, one behind and one in front of al-Mashrou’ Amer. 
    .         “Munir went up to the roof – without of course our father knowing – and he began to count the flags on top of the tanks. They numbered about 37 and more just in… our area.

    Around the same time (11.01am), 20 minutes after the armed column started moving north, <a href="#" class="testimony" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Mohsen">Saleh Abu Mohsen</a> and his three daughters left their home north of Salah al-Din Street, shortly after hearing a massive explosion. They also heard the tanks coming and feared “another massacre”. They reached Salah al-Din Street two minutes later, at 11.03am. “When we reached there I was surprised to find a [truck] trailer on fire,” said Saleh Abu Mohsen. He continued:

    Saleh Abu Mohsen said he saw four or five tanks on both sides of Salah al-Din Street, 15m away from him. Forensic Architecture identified six tanks and one D9 bulldozer at the entrance of the Sa’ad Sayel barracks and one D9 bulldozer on the satellite image taken half an hour later at 11.39am.

<p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
    Past the intersection, Saleh Abu Mohsen and his two surviving daughters ran north towards Abu Youssef al-Najjar Street to find an ambulance to return and pick up his missing daughter. “When I arrived there the ambulances were too busy because so much was happening in east Rafah and no one dared go east of the hospital,” he said.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Interview by Amnesty International fieldworker with Saleh Abu Mohsen, 9 September 2014." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> He did eventually convince an ambulance driver to risk the journey. From the ambulance, Saleh Abu Mohsen recalls seeing “burned cars and a drone-fired missile [fall] in front of the ambulance narrowly missing us.” Saleh Abu Mohsen and the ambulance driver were forced to return without finding his daughter. He finally found the body of his daughter, Asil Abu Mohsen, 17, four days later. Her body had gunfire wounds to the chest.

    Attacks on Abu Youssef al-Najjar Hospital
</span></div></div>
<div class="h3-block"><div class="box" style="margin-top:0;"><h5>
    The <a href="#" class="testimony" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Hospital">Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital</a> is located in eastern Rafah and treated dozens of wounded through the earlier part of 1 August. It was unable to deal with the amount of casualties it received. The Israeli army attacked the hospital building, its premises and streets in its immediate vicinity throughout the day, injuring doctors and patients and causing serious damage to the building. The hospital was eventually evacuated around 3.30pm on the afternoon of 1 August, when the attacks on the premises intensified and scores of patients rushed to evacuate the building, some while still connected to hospital equipment such as intravenous drips.
</h5></div>
<p>
One of the scenarios that the Israeli military considered was that the captured soldier Lieutenant Hadar Goldin had been wounded in the fire fight with Hamas fighters and would be taken to the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital, the medical facility closest to the area of capture. Dr Ashraf Mahmoud Hamad Hijazi, head of the Surgery Department at the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital describes what happened: “An officer from the Israeli intelligence services called a nurse at the hospital, said that the missing Israeli soldier was in the hospital and that we wouldn’t be allowed to leave the hospital until we released the soldier. This was absurd.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Interview by Amnesty International fieldworker with Dr Ashraf Hijazi, 14 August 2014." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    Dr Ashraf Hijazi arrived at the hospital around 9am. The flood of casualties started coming in at about 10am, he said. The hospital was overflowing with casualties and their families. He could not even count the dead and wounded. He says:
</p>
<div class="quote">
    <div class="quote-text">
        “The bombing began increasing and [bombs were] dropping continuously, and closer to the hospital. They bombed a house no further than 20m away from the hospital [and later] a missile fell at the door of the hospital.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Interview by Amnesty International fieldworker with Dr Ashraf Hijazi, 14 August 2014." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

<p>
    Dr Majed Ayesh Abu Taha, a bone specialist at the hospital, confirms that “a missile landed next to the main door. I had gone to see some patients in the clinic down there when a missile fell at the hospital’s main door. All of the clinic’s window glass flew out. I moved to the reception and another missile fell behind and all the reception glass fell out.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Interview by Amnesty International fieldworker with Dr Majed Abu Taha, 14 August 2014." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    The attacks around the hospital grew nearer and more frequent between 2pm and 2.30pm. Dr Ashraf Hijazi recalls: “There was the sound of the missile and a large explosion. I saw fire coming in from the window and it reached Dr Youssef’s [one of the hospital staff] arm”. Dr Majed Abu Taha remembers: “In the afternoon at 2.30pm I went upstairs to pray, and all the windows were blown out, the roof gone, and the door broken.”
</p>
<p>
    Studying photographs of the hospital taken by locals, photojournalists, and human rights defenders, Forensic Architecture noted both internal and external damage. On the satellite image taken on 14 August, one crater is visible about 120m south-west of the hospital and three craters about the same distance north-east of the hospital.

    Evacuating the Hospital

<p>
    Patients, staff and civilians seeking refuge at the hospital proceeded to evacuate the building en masse in a rush when the attacks on the premises intensified and it was believed that the hospital might be subjected to attack in the afternoon of 1 August. Dr Hijazi described how “some people started leaving the hospital through a back door but it was not safe”. Dr Abu Taha adds that “at 3.30pm the patients fled the hospital; some had plaster casts, with drips in their chests and stomachs. I saw a young boy in a plaster cast crawling trying to flee by dragging himself along.” <a href="#" class="testimony" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#Lafi">Abdel-Rahim Lafi</a>, who had arrived at the hospital with the body of his son Yehya and surviving members of his family, saw an unexploded missile at the front of the hospital and missile fire next to the hospital’s rear exit as he tried to flee through there.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Interview by Amnesty International fieldworker with Abdel-Rahim Lafi, 24 September 2014." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

    On Saturday 2 August the military forensic medicine unit assessed that Lieutenant Hadar Goldin was dead.

        Despite the determination that Lieutenant Goldin had died, the Israeli military continued its attacks in the Rafah area on 2-3 August.

    The practice is referred to by the Israeli army as “exposure”, which involves bulldozers and other heavy mechanical equipment digging out tunnel entrances and exits.

        The military did not manage to retrieve the remains of Lieutenant Goldin’s body. Heavy bombing of tunnel areas reduced the likelihood of finding him. His funeral on 3 August, arranged in an exceptional fashion, eventually allowed the Israeli military to leave the Gaza Strip without admitting that they had left a soldier behind. By 2pm on Sunday 3 August, the Israeli army had withdrawn most of its soldiers from Rafah.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="<i>Haaretz<i>, “LIVE UPDATES: Operation Protective Edge, day 27”, 4 August 2014, <a href='http  ://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.608548' target='_blank'>http    ://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.608548</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Forensic Architecture was able to locate at least two images of smoke plumes on 3 August indicating that aerial attacks had not ceased.

    The D9 bulldozers, the digging equipment and the securing forces were the last units to leave the Gaza Strip on 4 August. The conflict continued until 26 August as a series of cross-border fire exchanges that saw the significant escalation of aerial bombing.

    Shift in proportionality

        The pounding of Rafah continued for three days after the initial strikes of 1 August. Under the veil of the Hannibal Directive, the Israeli army enacted a “gloves off” policy whereby it struck general targets from its “target banks” – a continuously updated list of targets prepared by the military intelligence – that were not previously authorized because they were determined to involve too high levels of collateral damage.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Israeli army Radio (Galei Tzahal), “Exclusive: New Details about the Rafah Battle” (in Hebrew), 14 April 2015, <a href='http://glz.co.il/1138-61304-he/Galatz.aspx' target='_blank'>http://glz.co.il/1138-61304-he/Galatz.aspx</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015). " data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> This type of bombing continued even after the Israeli army’s chief rabbi signed Lieutenant Goldin’s death certificate.
    </h5></div>
    <p>
        The striking of these type of targets points to a shift in the Israeli army’s own proportionality calculations and appeared to be meant to generate a level of destruction that would deter future capture attempts. Colonel Ofer Winter, commander of the Givati Brigade, who activated the Hannibal Directive on 1 August, suggests he was clear about the logic of the action taken: “Anyone who abducts should know that he will pay a price. This was not revenge. They simply messed with the wrong brigade.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Interview with Colonel Ofer Winter by Yossi Yehoshua in <i>Yedioth Ahronoth</i>, 15 August 2014 (paper-only edition)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>
        <p>
            Post-conflict briefings to soldiers and public statements of Israeli officers suggest that the high death toll and massive destruction were not seen as regrettable side effects but “achievements” or “accomplishments” that would keep Gaza “quiet for five years”. An Intelligence Corps soldier quoted senior army officers as saying: “2,000 dead and 11,000 wounded, half a million refugees, decades’ worth of destruction. Harm to lots of senior Hamas members and to their homes, to their families. These were stated as accomplishments so that no one would doubt that what we did during this period was meaningful.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Peter Beaumont, ”Israeli soldiers cast doubt on legality of Gaza military tactics”, <i>The Guardian</i>, 4 May 2015, <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/04/israeli-soldiers-cast-doubt-on-legality-of-gaza-military-operation' target='_blank'>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/04/israeli-soldiers-cast-doubt-on-legality-of-gaza-military-operation</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Another Israeli soldier told Breaking the Silence that the aim in bombings was to “deter them, scare them, wear them down psychologically”.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Breaking the Silence, “Deter them, scare them, wear them down psychologically”, <a href='http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/testimonies/database/760951' target='_blank'>http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/testimonies/database/760951</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

            Israeli army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said Israel’s assaults were mostly aimed at convincing Hamas never to try it again: “When they come out of their bunkers and they look around, they are going to have to make a serious estimation of whether what they have done was worth it.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="AP, “Even if rockets remain, Israel hopes massive air campaign will deter Hamas from firing again”, 14 July 2014, in Fox News, <a href='http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/07/14/even-if-rockets-remain-israel-hopes-massive-air-campaign-will-deter-hamas-from/' target='_blank'>http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/07/14/even-if-rockets-remain-israel-hopes-massive-air-campaign-will-deter-hamas-from/</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> These statements indicate an intention to generate material damage as a deterrent.

            The Israeli army’s firing policy has been revealed in a number of testimonies from soldiers and officers serving in the field and from command centres. These testimonies, given to Breaking the Silence, confirm that targets that were not previously authorized, because military planners deemed they involved too high a level of civilian casualties, were authorized after the Hannibal Directive was launched. They describe three levels of fire.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Breaking the Silence, <i>This is How We Fought in Gaza: Soldiers’ testimonies and photographs from Operation “Protective Edge” (2014)</i>, Tel Aviv, 2015, <a href='http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf' target='_blank'>http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015), testimony 91, pp. 198-199; testimony 109, pp. 229-230." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> The first expects a “low level of civilian harm”, the second a “moderate level” and the third a “necessary level”, where a high level of harm to civilians is expected.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Breaking the Silence, <i>This is How We Fought in Gaza: Soldiers’ testimonies and photographs from Operation “Protective Edge” (2014)</i>, Tel Aviv, 2015, <a href='http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf' target='_blank'>http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015), testimony 107, pp. 226-227; testimony 95, pp. 204-205." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Every level routinely requires authorization from different levels of command, unless the forces involved are at immediate risk or a Hannibal Directive is declared, in which case the decision is left to the field commander in charge.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Breaking the Silence, <i>This is How We Fought in Gaza: Soldiers’ testimonies and photographs from Operation “Protective Edge” (2014)</i>, Tel Aviv, 2015, <a href='http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf' target='_blank'>http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015), testimony 107, pp. 226-227; testimony 91, pp. 198-199." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> According to the testimonies, after the Hannibal Directive was declared many targets that were classified as the highest level, such as multi-story buildings or structures located in densely populated areas, were approved for attack and attacked regardless of whether they would help extracting the soldier.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Breaking the Silence, <i>This is How We Fought in Gaza: Soldiers’ testimonies and photographs from Operation “Protective Edge” (2014)</i>, Tel Aviv, 2015, <a href='http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf' target='_blank'>http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/pdf/ProtectiveEdge.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015), testimony 95, pp. 204-205." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> A military planner describes the determination of targets:
