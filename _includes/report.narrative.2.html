				<p>The Mare Nostrum (MN) operation was launched in response to the tragic shipwreck that occurred on 3 October 2013. On the morning of that day, a boat carrying more than 500 migrants sank less than one kilometre from the coast of Lampedusa, causing the death of at least 366 people.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See WatchTheMed, &ldquo;At least 366 people dead in wreck 1 km from Lampedusa&rdquo;, 24 December 2013, <a href='http://watchthemed.net/reports/view/31'>http://watchthemed.net/reports/view/31</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016). It is often forgotten that this shipwreck was quickly followed by another one on October 11. In that case, as the investigation conducted by the WatchTheMed network and journalist Fabrizio Gatti revealed, the deployment of rescue to a boat carrying over 400 people that had started taking in water after it had been shot by a Libyan vessel was delayed for over 5 hours due to conflicts of responsibility between the Italian and Maltese Coast Guards. Rescue vessels arrived one hour after the boat had sunk and more than 200 people had died.

Between 7 and 8 October 2013, ministers gathered at the Justice and Home Affairs meeting of the European Council in Luxemburg &ldquo;held an exchange of views on the <em>actions that are needed to avoid such tragedies</em>&rdquo;.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Council of the European Union, Press Release following the 3260th Council meeting,</p>

				<p>In the following days and weeks, however, it became clear that the &ldquo;actions&rdquo; and &ldquo;tools&rdquo; identified by the EU to avoid massive loss of lives at sea would be geared only in the direction of strengthening border control, not rescue at sea. In the immediate aftermath of the 3 October shipwreck, the EU President, José Manuel Barroso, announced the final implementation of the EU-wide Eurosur surveillance system and the reinforcement of Frontex, the EU border control agency.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="European Commission, &ldquo;Statement by President Barroso following his visit to Lampedusa&rdquo;, 9 October 2013, <a href='http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-792_en.htm'>http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-792_en.htm</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>

				<p>This direction continued to be reaffirmed over the next six months of successive reports and meetings between the different EU bodies. During these meetings, no common measures granting migrants legal access to EU territory and safe transport, would even be considered. Such measures, if initiated, would end precarious means of crossing, and importantly, the necessity to resort to smugglers. Moreover, EU member states and institutions made no substantial efforts to support the rescue of migrants at sea. Assessing this institutional process that unfolded after October 2013, Amnesty International&rsquo;s Secretary General, Salil Shetty, stated on 21 January 2014:</p>

				<p>The Italian government decided to adopt a different strategy and, in light of migrants&rsquo; increasing crossings and deaths, Italy prioritized rescue at sea. On 18 October 2013, the Italian government single-handedly launched what has been by far the largest &ldquo;humanitarian and security&rdquo; operation in the Mediterranean: <em>Mare Nostrum</em>.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="<a href='http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/generalnews/2013/10/15/Immigration-Italy-launches-Mare-Nostrum-400-saved_9466386.html'>ANSAmed, &ldquo;Immigration: Italy launches Mare Nostrum, 400 more saved&rdquo;, <em>ANSAMed</em>, 15 October 2013, http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/generalnews/2013/10/15/Immigration-Italy-launches-Mare-Nostrum-400-saved_9466386.html</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016).

These patrolled the sea for over one year with the specific tasks of intercepting and rescuing all migrants&rsquo; vessels departing from the Libyan coasts.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="For the list of units the Italian Navy deployed in the frame of MN, Marina Militare, Mare Nostrum Operation, see <a href='http://www.marina.difesa.it/EN/operations/Pagine/MareNostrum.aspx'>http://www.marina.difesa.it/EN/operations/Pagine/MareNostrum.aspx</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> The scale of MN was unprecedented; so was the inscription of the humanitarian &ldquo;duty&rdquo; of saving lives at the core of MN&rsquo;s mission, which was coupled with the aim of bringing to justice those deemed responsible for putting their lives at risk, i.e. the smugglers.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="According to Italian Coast Guard data, 83.000 out of the over 170.000 migrants who reached Italy by sea in 2014 were rescued by MN means." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> This shift of mission produced several breaks in the way rescue and border enforcement at sea had been practiced until then. With MN, rescue activities reached an unprecedented expansion in their spatial deployment. Until then, search and rescue (SAR) operations in the (undeclared) Libyan SAR zone were a rare event and the majority of migrants&rsquo; boats reached Italian and Maltese coasts on their own or were simply &ldquo;escorted&rdquo; for the last few nautical miles.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="This has been the case in particular until September 2011, when the island of Lampedusa was declared a &ldquo;non-safe port&rdquo;.

During several interviews conducted between 2011 and 2015, the Italian Coast Guard and border police confirmed to us this information." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> During MN, military vessels were continuously positioned in close proximity of the Libyan coast, and intercepted and rescued every migrants&rsquo; boat that they encountered. Moreover, while disembarkation had constituted a thorny problem for many years<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See &ldquo;Background&rdquo; section." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>, with MN, migrants rescued in the central Mediterranean were taken to Italy by default. MN thus constituted a clear shift away from the reluctance of states to carry out rescue operations and the criminalisation of those who engaged in this, which had led to cases of non-assistance in the past.</p>

<p>MN, however, had ambivalent results from a humanitarian point of view and became increasingly contested, both within Italy and at the EU level.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Critics of MN argued in particular that the operation did not constitute a viable response to the drama of migrants dying at sea because (1) it constituted a &ldquo;pull factor&rdquo; and (2) it inadvertently led to more deaths instead of saving more lives, since it led to more crossings and smugglers, as a consequence of its presence, started sending migrants off in increasingly precarious conditions. While it is a fact that <em>during</em> Mare Nostrum&rsquo;s period of operation a record number of migrants arrived on EU shores and a record number of deaths were reported, an analysis of migration patterns <em>before, during</em> and <em>after</em> the operation shows that MN was not the root cause of the trends that unfolded during this period.</p>
<p><strong>THE &ldquo;PULL FACTOR&rdquo; CRITICSM</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>One criticism of MN was that it led to an increase in the number of arrivals on Italian shores. The availability of a great number of assets dedicated to rescue operations close to the Libyan coast, it was argued, was actually encouraging more migrants to start the crossing on unseaworthy vessels and to put their lives in the hands of unscrupulous smugglers. As a result, the argument continued, to curb arrivals it was necessary to end MN. Politicians across the EU such as the UK Foreign Office Minister Lady Anelay echoed the Italian xenophobic Lega Nord party in denouncing search and rescue operations as a &ldquo;pull factor&rdquo;, thereby justifying her government&rsquo;s refusal to fund the continuation of the operation.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>
<p>At first glance, the data on arrivals during 2014 seems to confirm this argument. Arrivals in Italy went from slightly over 40,000 in 2013 to over 170,000 in 2014. Looking at 2013 trends more closely, however, we can see that the increase in the number of crossing had started well before MN. This tendency was indicated by Frontex itself, which in its risk analysis regarding the July to September 2013 period (i.e., before the beginning of MN), observed the most significant increase in crossings since 2011.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irregular migration in the Central Mediterranean increased staggeringly between the second and third quarters of 2013. Compared to detections during every other quarter in 2012 and 2013 the increase was both sudden and dramatic to a total of over 22 000 detected migrants.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>
<p>Frontex Risk Analysis</p>
<p>With this increase, 75 percent of the yearly arrivals were reported in only four months.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> The agency further noted that, despite it being winter, which leads to less crossings, 2,476 crossings were recorded in December 2013, &ldquo;the largest for a month of December since 2008&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>
<p>Frontex figures for July&ndash;September 2013. The graphs show a strong increase during this period, and Syrians becoming the top nationality crossing the central Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Two main factors can be mentioned to explain the increase recorded in 2013, which would continue to mark 2014 as well. The first one is the Syrian exodus, which in the summer of 2013 went, as a UNHCR report tellingly put it, &ldquo;from slow boil to breaking point&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Until the summer of 2013, Syrians had mostly sought refuge in other areas within their own country or in neighbouring countries (Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt).<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> However, the increasing numbers of refugees quickly exceeded both the capacity of humanitarian organisations and of neighbouring countries, which began reintroducing visa obligations for Syrians.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Over 2013, as the civil war became more and more entrenched, the Syrian exodus increased markedly &ndash; with the number of Syrian refugees doubling from one million in March 2013 to two million in September 2013.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> As a result, Syrians became increasingly likely to seek refugee ever further, including by crossing the sea from Libya. This trend would continue apace throughout 2014.</p>
<p>The second key factor was the increasing level of violence that resulted from the progressive collapse of the transition process in Libya. The process of political fragmentation led to mounting violence that affected Libyan society at large but in had a particularly grave influence on migrants, who were subjected to multiple forms of violence at different moments of their trajectory.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> This led a growing number of foreign nationals who had been residing in the country (including Syrians, 14,056 of whom were registered with the UNHCR in Libya by 30 September 2013)<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> to attempt the crossing of the central Mediterranean.</p>
<p><strong>The intensification of crossings can thus not be attributed solely to the presence of MN, since they resulted from deeper regional political factors that were leading to this trend <em>before</em> MN. As we will discuss in more detail in the &ldquo;After Mare Nostrum&rdquo; section, the fact that MN was not the major cause is further confirmed by the comparable scale of crossings <em>after </em>MN.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE &ldquo;INCREASING DEATH&rdquo; CRITICSM</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>The other main criticism put forth to justify ending support for MN was that the operation increased the danger of the crossings, as it prompted a shift in smugglers&rsquo; practices. Smugglers, it was argued, were relying on the presence of MN to operate rescue at an early stage and were thus providing subpar crossing conditions, thus provoking more deaths. Frontex&rsquo;s executive director, Gil Arias, epitomized this position in his answer to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) of the European Parliament on 4 September 2014:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of saying that it has been a pull factor but obviously the smugglers have abused of the proximity of the operation to the Libyan coast to, on the one hand to put more people on the sea, with the assumption that they will be rescued very soon, and this also made it cheaper for them, as I said, because they put and they are putting less fuel, less food, less water on the vessel, which at the same time also increases the risk for the migrants.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>
<p>Gil Arias, Frontex&rsquo;s executive director</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s analyse this claim. First, it is a fact that while MN allowed for a record number of people to be rescued, a record number of 3,186 deaths were also reported in the central Mediterranean in 2014 alone.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> During the period of Mare Nostrum&rsquo;s operation, then, the crossing did not become less dangerous and the mortality rate actually slightly increased from 15/1,000 in 2013 to 18.4/1,000 in 2014, with a peak in the summer.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> So while MN did not make the crossing substantially more dangerous, as its critics held, it is also true that it did not make it <em>less</em> dangerous. It is also a documented fact that smuggling practices evolved <em>during </em>the time of the MN operation, and partly adapting to its presence. It is certainly likely that this shift contributed to making the crossing more dangerous, leading to &ldquo;a new strategy of deliberately meeting, instead of bypassing controls, but also using even more <em>unseaworthy boats, loading them ever more, and providing less food and fuel</em>&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>
<p>Average number of people loaded per boat, 2013-2014.</p>
<p><strong>The problem with the argument outlined by Frontex&rsquo;s executive director, Gil Arias, however, is that such a claim assumes a causal chain between MN, smuggling practices and increased risk for migrants. Such an understanding however is insufficient to explain the rise of deaths and slight rise in mortality. First of all, shifts in the practices of smugglers attributed to MN emerged before MN. Secondly, there were factors other than smugglers&rsquo; practices that contributed to the rising death toll.</strong></p>
<p>Smugglers in Libya had been operating a well-established business since the beginning of the century thanks to their stable relations with the Qaddafi regime.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> The fall of the Libyan regime, however, led to changes in smuggling practices that have made the conditions of the crossing more dangerous. In particular, as Nancy Porsia details in her report included in the annex, the practices of smugglers had already started to considerably change <em>during 2013</em> in parallel to the dwindling hopes for a stable and prosperous post-revolutionary future. The Libyan political fragmentation led in fact to more volatile relations between smugglers and the factions in control of particular areas but also allowed new actors &ndash; who offered lower prices but did not always possess the willingness or the know-how to organise safe crossings &ndash; to enter the smuggling market.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> This in turn meant that to guarantee a profitable margin, smugglers had to resort to subpar navigation equipment or to loading more migrants on board their unsafe boats. In its 19 November 2013 report for the &ldquo;Task Force Mediterranean&rdquo;, the European External Action Service (EEAS) noted the trend towards &ldquo;increasing numbers of migrants on the boats, which are overloaded and/or unseaworthy, leading to an increasing risk of fatalities especially along the central Mediterranean route&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> As this document was produced only days after the start of MN, it cannot describe a shift brought about by MN, but rather a pre-existing situation. This tendency only increased in the following months and, as Porsia notes, &ldquo;as of late 2013, the standards of the smugglers&rsquo; service drastically dropped: very often the migrants were put at sea with no life jacket, no satellite phone or GPS&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> The shipwrecks of October 2013 and the resulting peak in mortality at the time, as indicated in the data put together by Philippe Faruges and his colleagues (figure below), may be seen as the result of these tendencies in smugglers practices.</p>
<p>Migrant mortality rate in the central Mediterranean, 2011-2015.</p>
<p>The changes in the practices of smugglers and the increase in the danger of crossing were thus well underway <em>before</em> MN was launched and cannot be attributed to the latter. Rather, it seems that MN could not make up for and may have exacerbated a shift in the practices of smugglers that was already underway. This shift would probably have occurred anyway without MN as a result of the combination of the increasing number of people willing to cross the sea and the volatility of the Libyan context mentioned above. The peak in the mortality rate recorded in October 2013 provides an indication of the danger migrants might have continued to face without MN &ndash; a peak that, we should note, was reached during the period of Mare Nostrum&rsquo;s operation. What is clear is that MN could only address this increasing danger of the crossings partially, as MN assets deployed close to the Libyan coast came to operate as a &ldquo;half-way bridge to Europe&rdquo;,<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> still forcing migrants to resort to the service of smugglers for the first stretch of their journey.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we believe that beyond the practices of smugglers, other factors contributing to migrants&rsquo; deaths at sea were at work. Firstly, while providing detailed reconstructions of the cases of deaths that occurred during 2014 is beyond the scope of this report, a cursory glance reveals that several of the largest cases of deaths at sea of summer 2014 amounted to simple murder, and that this murderous behaviour cannot be attributed to the effects of MN.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Secondly, the spike in deaths at sea and mortality during the summer of 2014 (June&ndash;September) coincided with the worsening political context in Libya (see Porsia in annex), which certainly contributed to increased crossings<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> and may have impacted the practices of smugglers described above.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> It seems to have been beyond the capacity of MN to respond to this high number of crossings occurring in highly precarious conditions. MN assets themselves were overwhelmed by the novel scale of crossings and the shift in their modus operandi, which is indicated by the increasing recourse to commercial vessels to commercial vessels over this same period.</p>
<p>Frontex figure showing that the number of people rescued by the shipping industry suddenly reached more than 20 percent in June 2014 and remained consistently high after that.</p>
<p><strong>What emerges from the above is that MN began operating in the midst of a growing storm, in which the combined exodus of Syrians (and of other nationalities), together with growing instability in transit countries such as Egypt and Libya, and the resulting changing practices of smugglers were leading to record numbers of crossings in increasingly dangerous conditions.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34"><strong>[34]</strong></a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="CHANGE_THIS" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Despite the vast resources put in place, MN did not manage to curb the increasing mortality rate at sea. However, it is also clear that MN was not the main cause of this increase. </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Considering the trends of late 2013, it is probable that without MN in place, a similar number of arrivals would have been reached, and both the number of deaths and mortality would have continued to soar, as the twin October 2013 shipwrecks indicate. The peak in the mortality rate observed in summer 2014 further suggests, it was not less of MN that was needed to bring the number of deaths and the danger of crossings down, but <em>more</em> of it.</p>
<p><strong>The ending of MN was thus justified on the argument that MN was the cause of more arrivals and more deaths. However, if, as we have demonstrated, increased crossings and deaths were related to deeper regional factors, discontinuing Mare Nostrum would not lead to less crossings but to more deaths at sea. This forecast was available to EU policy makers and agencies, and yet, as the following sections will show, they decided to end MN and (not)replace it with a more limited Frontex operation in all knowledge of the deadly consequences this policy would have.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /> </strong></p>
<p><strong>INSTITUTIONALISED NEGLET</strong></p>
<p>While the criticism that MN led to more crossings and more deaths was thus unfounded, these arguments were put forward by EU member states and agencies to respond negatively to Italy&rsquo;s calls to hand over MN to the EU by transforming Frontex&rsquo;s central Mediterranean operation into a Europeanised Mare Nostrum. Instead, a much more limited operation called &ldquo;Triton&rdquo; would be implemented by Frontex.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The deadly effects of the rapid removal of MN were predicted by several actors, including EU agencies, but across EU institutional bodies and agencies the warnings were ignored. In what follows, we offer a reconstruction of this process of institutional wilful neglect that spans from April 2014 to January 2015.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>This reconstruction is based on operational documents, previously unpublished minutes of four meetings (20.08.2014; 24.09.2014; 9.10.2014; 16.10.2014) that Frontex officers had with their Italian and Maltese counterparts, an extensive review of parliamentary discussions and transcripts of official meetings, press releases and official statements by NGOs.</p>
<p><strong>FROM MARE NOSTRUM TO TRITON</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Deeming that the costs of the operation (9.5 million euros per month) should be shared by all EU member states,<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a> already on 16 April 2014 the Italian Ministry of Interior Angelino Alfano declared to the Italian parliament that &ldquo;Frontex will have to take on a leading role in directing and coordinating patrolling in the Mediterranean.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a> On 11 June, the Italian parliament voted on a motion proposing an exit strategy from Mare Nostrum and its replacement by a &ldquo;conjoint action by the international community&rdquo;. At the same time, Alfano revealed to the press that he had a long conversation with Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, in which he invoked an exit strategy from Mare Nostrum that involved the EU.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a> On 24 June, presenting his priorities for the then upcoming Italian presidency of the Council of the EU, Italian Prime Minister Renzi stated that Italy would request at an EU Council summit a few days later that &ldquo;MN becomes an operation part of Frontex&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></p>
<p>Over the summer of 2014, a long and sinuous institutional process unfolded during which the contours of the Frontex mission were debated and defined, ultimately leading to a much more limited mission that was a far cry from Italy&rsquo;s request that Frontex &ldquo;take on the duties of Mare Nostrum&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"><sup><sup>[39]</sup></sup></a> At the 26&ndash;27 June European Council meeting, the Council concluded vaguely that &ldquo;Frontex should reinforce its operational assistance, in particular to support Member States facing strong pressure at the external borders.&rdquo; This was enough for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to state on 29 June 2014 that &ldquo;today, Italy is less alone in the Mediterranean&rdquo;, asserting that the agreement regarding migration policies reached at the European summit is &ldquo;a truly significant step forward&rdquo; because it established &ldquo;the basis for being able to finally breathe life into a Frontex &lsquo;-plus&rsquo;, broadening its operations&rdquo;.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><sup><sup>[40]</sup></sup></a> However, the limits of the MN substitute operation proposed by the EU became clear when, following the EU Minister of Interiors and Minister of Justice Informal Meeting on July 9 in Milan, Home Affairs Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m&nbsp;said that she was discussing with Alfano what was needed for a &ldquo;scaled-down&rdquo; version of Mare Nostrum:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frontex is a small agency and cannot take over Mare Nostrum tomorrow. [&hellip;] Frontex can do a lot, but we do not have the means to totally substitute (Mare Nostrum) unless all other member countries also contribute with vessels or helicopters or staff or money.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"><sup><sup>[41]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The reticence of member states was however already voiced as they exited the meeting. While German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told Deutsche Welle at the interior ministers&rsquo; meeting in Milan that &ldquo;it cannot be the permanent task of the Italian navy to take in refugees,&rdquo; he argued that &ldquo;the idea of passing the task on to Frontex is unrealistic in my eyes.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42"><sup><sup>[42]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>Discussions between Italy, Frontex and the Commission continued throughout the summer. On 26 August, Italian officials met with Frontex representatives and a European Commission delegation in Rome. The results of their talks were discussed during a meeting between Malmstr&ouml;m and Alfano in Brussels on 27 August.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"><sup><sup>[43]</sup></sup></a> Following her meeting with Alfano, in an official press release Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m stated that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have decided that the two ongoing Frontex operations Hermes and Aeneas will be merged and extended into a new upgraded operation. The aim is to put in place an enlarged &lsquo;Frontex plus&rsquo; to complement what Italy has been doing.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"><sup><sup>[44]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Commission has not granted us the minutes of the meeting between Alfano and Malmstr&ouml;m, we have accessed a number of documents that allow us to get an impression of the negotiations between different actors at the operational level following this policy decision, and to assess the knowledge they had of the consequences of ending MN in terms of the risk of crossing for migrants.</p>
<p><strong>TRITON&rsquo;S OPERATIONAL PLANNING</strong></p>
<p>On 28 August, Frontex issued a &ldquo;concept document&rdquo; on the future of Frontex&rsquo;s Hermes and Aeneas operations in the central Mediterranean (see annex). Written at a time when the ending of MN had not yet been formally announced, the document proposed that operation Hermes 2014 either be extended in the case of the continuation of MN, or be upgraded to new operation Triton if MN was terminated. The document contains two sections: first, an assessment aiming to &ldquo;provide analytical support to decision making at Frontex&rdquo;; and second, the proposal that emerged from this decision making. Crucially, the assessment notes that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;the withdrawal of naval assets from the area, if not properly planned and announced well in advance, would likely result in a higher number of fatalities.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"><sup><sup>[45]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>Frontex concept document for operation Triton</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>As a result, the following recommendation is formulated concerning the operational area:</p>
<p>&ldquo;if operation Mare Nostrum discontinues in the future, then Frontex should consider extending the operational area of the JO Hermes 2014 and consider to which extent the objectives of effective border control and contribution to saving lives can be achieved.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></p>
<p>Frontex concept document for operation Triton</p>
<p>In the actual proposal however, considering the scenario in which MN is terminated, the operational zones of Hermes and Aneas are effectively merged into a new Triton operation, but are not extended further south, thus remaining far from the extent of MN (see map comparing zones).</p>
<p>Map comparing the operational zones of Italian Navy&rsquo;s Mare Nostrum and Frontex&rsquo;s Triton. Credit: Forensic Oceanography. GIS analysis: Rossana Padeletti. Design: Samaneh Moafi.</p>
<p><strong>Frontex was thus aware that ending MN abruptly could lead to an increased risk of migrants&rsquo; deaths, and that as such specific counter-measures should have been taken, including extending the operational zone. It decided, however, to ignore this risk and not to follow its own internal recommendation in the actual proposal for the new operation. </strong></p>
<p>The minutes of the meetings held between August and October 2014 by Frontex, Italian and Maltese agencies, and the EU Commission provide further examples of how these concerns were not considered at an operational level. In these meetings, Italy repeatedly requested that more important means be dedicated to the Frontex operation being defined, including Navy assets, but Frontex responded that this was beyond the means allocated to the operation and defended its operation&rsquo;s spatial retreat.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a> On one particular occasion, an official of the Italian Navy did state explicitly that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;in the case Mare Nostrum finishes, the new operation in the area will have surely extra work as concerns SAR.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></p>
<p>Italian Navy Official</p>
<p>During none of the meetings between Italy and Frontex, including after the ending of MN was formally announced in October, were concrete measures planned by Frontex or Italy in response to this warning, nor to the increased risks to the lives of migrants it would entail. While these risks were being publically evoked on numerous occasions (see below), they always remained outside the purview of these operational meetings.</p>
<p><strong>DISREGARDING EXTERNAL VOICES</strong></p>
<p>While the risk to the lives of migrants was simply absent from Frontex&rsquo;s operational meetings with member states, there were other opportunities within EU institutional bodies to give heed to this concern. This was the case for instance of the hearing at the European Parliament&rsquo;s committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) held on 3 and 4 September. On that occasion, Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m and Frontex Interim Executive Director Gil Arias provided further clarifications to Members of the European Parliament, who in turn responded with questions and comments.</p>
<p>It is worth quoting the minutes of this meeting at length. The intervention of Arias is particularly important. In it, Arias reiterated the criticism of Mare Nostrum being a pull-factor and representing an increased danger for migrants at sea that we have tackled above. As a consequence, he specified that:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;joint operation Triton will <em>not</em> replace Mare Nostrum. Neither the mandate, nor the available resources, allow for that replacement.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a></p>
<p>Gil Arias, Frontex Interim Executive Director</p>
<p>He then clearly presented Triton as a retreat from MN&rsquo;s spatial extent and its proactive mission to rescue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This operation will be closer to EU shores than Mare Nostrum. [&hellip;] In any case, the difference between Mare Nostrum and Triton is fundamentally the nature of the two operations. While Mare Nostrum is clearly a search and rescue operation, Triton will be with a main focus on border control, border management, although as it is obvious saving lives is an absolute priority, and in fact very frequently the control operations, the border control operations coordinated by the agency turn into search and rescue operations, and this is how it works in practice.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></p>
<p>Gil Arias, Frontex Interim Executive Director</p>
<p>At no point in his presentation, however, did Arias evoke the additional risks for the lives of migrants that such a retreat might entail &ndash; and of which he must have known, since this risk had been assessed by his own agency. This risk was clearly recalled to him in the response by Italian MEP Barbara Spinelli:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we know that Mare Nostrum is not going to be replaced by Frontex or Frontex Plus, nor by Triton or Hermes, so there is not actually going to be any search and rescue operation. I can draw two conclusions here. Basically Italy is being left on its own, and secondly there is going to be no more Mare Nostrum programme and people are going to be dying in the Mediterranean again. Mr Arias Fernandez, are you aware of those two conclusions?&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></p>
<p>Barabra Spinelli, Member of the European Parliament</p>
<p>Arias did not fundamentally address these comments, but limited himself to reiterating the mission of Frontex:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be worth to repeat once again: while saving lives is an absolute priority, the operations coordinated by Frontex have as main focus border management, and contribution to search and rescue activities which are under the responsibility of the national competent authorities.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></p>
<p>Gil Arias, Frontex Interim Executive Director</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>From what precedes, it appears that the additional risk for the lives of migrants that the ending of MN and its replacement by Triton would entail was mentioned at several moments within EU institutional bodies and agencies, but that these warnings were deliberately ignored and at times, as Arias&rsquo;s statement exemplifies, not properly communicated to EU politicians by the EU border agency.</strong></p>
<p>This is all the more striking considering the many warnings and criticisms formulated publically from without EU institutional bodies once the limitations of the Triton operation became clear.</p>
<p>On 15 September, days after the LIBE hearing, Amnesty International vocally criticised this turn in policy in its report, <em>Lives Adrift</em>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;People will attempt the crossing, with or without Operation Mare Nostrum in place. But without it, many, many more will die.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></p>
<p>Amnesty International</p>
<p>On 17 October 2014 the UNHCR stated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;UNHCR is concerned over the announcement of the ending this month of the Italian operation Mare Nostrum without a similar European search and rescue operation to replace it. This will undoubtedly increase the risk for those trying to find safety in Europe, and could lead to more refugees and migrants perishing at sea.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a></p>
<p>UNHCR</p>
<p>On 5 December 2014, Fran&ccedil;ois Cr&eacute;peau, United Nations Rapporteur on the rights of migrants warned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fear is that, next summer, without an operation like Mare Nostrum, thousands of people will die. Turning a blind eye isn&rsquo;t a solution: people will continue to cross and, because of Europe&rsquo;s inaction, to die&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55"><em><strong>[55]</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Cr&eacute;peau, United Nations Rapporteur on the rights of migrants</p>
<p>These warnings stemming from within EU agencies, EU institutional bodies, UN organisations and human rights NGOs were not heeded to. On 9&ndash;10 October, the Justice and Home Affairs Council welcomed the launch of Triton, due on 1 November, and Italy&rsquo;s Interior Minister Angelino Alfano formally announced the that Operation Mare Nostrum would end by the end of the year.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56"><sup><sup>[56]</sup></sup></a> After a period of &ldquo;phasing out&rdquo; between November and December, from 1 January 2015, the central Mediterranean was left with Triton, which had a much smaller budget &ndash; initially 2.9 million euros per month &ndash; and fewer available assets patrolling a smaller area, extending up to thirty nautical miles from Lampedusa.<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a></p>
<p>Why were the increased risk to the lives of migrants either disregarded or not mentioned at all by Frontex and EU member states? Fran&ccedil;ois Cr&eacute;peau, United Nations Rapporteur on the rights of migrants, provided his own interpretation on 30 October 2014. On this occasion he was responding to the statement by UK Foreign Office Minister Lady Anelay, who justified her decision to axe UK support to SAR operations in the Mediterranean by accusing them of being a pull-factor.<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a> Cr&eacute;peau replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like saying, let them die because this is a good deterrence. [&hellip;] To bank on the rise in the number of dead migrants to act as deterrence for future migrants and asylum seekers is appalling.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a></p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Cr&eacute;peau, United Nations Rapporteur on the rights of migrants</p>
<p>While Cr&eacute;peau&rsquo;s statement was only a well-grounded deduction, the newly released Frontex&rsquo;s Tactical focused assessment for Triton from 14 January 2015 confirms that the rationale for this retreat of state-operated rescue was indeed to act as a deterrent for migrants and smugglers in the aim of stemming crossings:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end of Operation Mare Nostrum on 31 December 2014 will have a direct impact on the JO Triton 2014. The fact that most interceptions and rescue missions will only take place inside the operational area could become a deterrence for facilitation networks and migrants that can only depart from, the Libyan or Egyptian coast with favourable weather conditions and taking into account that the boat must now navigate for several days before being rescued or intercepted.&rdquo; <a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a></p>
<p>Frontex Tactical Focused Assessment for operation Triton</p>
<p><strong>From all of the above, what emerges is that in the ending of MN and the planning of Triton, the aim of Frontex and EU member states of seeking to deter the arrivals of migrants took precedent over taking into account the information concerning the additional risks that the cutting back of interception/rescue operations would entail for the lives of migrants. More than that, the </strong><strong>increased risks to the lives of migrants that were being publically evoked on numerous occasions were never considered in any operational decision and consistently remained outside the purview of EU decision makers.</strong></p>

Brussels: European Foundation for Democracy, 2015, pp. 73-87. Empirical evidence collected by Porsia and Frontex confirms once again these facts. In terms of the unseaworthyness of boats, the interviews by Porsia indicate that, while a shortage of wooden boats had begun at the end of 2013, with SAR operations occurring closer to the Libyan coast, &ldquo;smugglers also began to retrieve the boats abandoned by the Italian Navy after the rescue operations and re-use them for as many as six further trips&rdquo; which evidently affected the seaworthiness of the vessels (Porsia 2015, p. 77). In addition, the increasing tendency to extreme overloading of boats is also documented by Frontex data on the number of people per boat (see below).</p>
