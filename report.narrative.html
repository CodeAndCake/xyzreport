				</div>

				<p>The week commencing 12 April 2015 saw what is believed to be the largest loss of life at sea in the recent history of the Mediterranean. On 12 April, 400 people died when an overcrowded boat capsized due to its passengers&rsquo; excitement at the sight of tugboats approaching to rescue them. Less than a week later, on 18 April, a similar incident took an even greater toll in human lives, leading the deadliest single shipwreck recorded by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the Mediterranean.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), &ldquo;Mediterranean boat capsizing: deadliest incident on record&rdquo;,&nbsp;21 April 2015, <a href='http://www.unhcr.org/553652699.html'>http://www.unhcr.org/553652699.html</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Over 800 people are believed to have died when a migrants&rsquo; vessel sank after colliding with a cargo ship that had approached to carry out a rescue operation due to a mis-manoeuvre. More than 1200 lives were thus lost in a single week. As M&eacute;decins sans frontieres (MSF) commented at the time, these figures eerily resemble those of a war zone.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), &ldquo;MSF calls for large scale search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean&rdquo;,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>20 April 2015, <a href='http://www.msf.org/article/msf-calls-large-scale-search-and-rescue-operation-mediterranean'>http://www.msf.org/article/msf-calls-large-scale-search-and-rescue-operation-mediterranean</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>


				<p>Beyond their huge death toll, what is most striking about these events is that they were not the result of the reluctance to carry out rescue operations, which has been identified as a structural cause of migrants&rsquo; deaths in the Mediterranean Sea and which we have documented in previous reports.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See &ldquo;Background&rdquo; section of this report and Forensic Oceanography&rsquo;s previous investigation on the &ldquo;Left-to-die Boat&rdquo; case available at <a href='http://www.forensic-architecture.org/case/left-die-boat/'>http://www.forensic-architecture.org/case/left-die-boat/</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> In these two cases, the actual loss of life occurred <em>during</em> and partly <em>through</em> the rescue operation itself. The detailed reconstruction of these two successive tragedies provided in this report in the &ldquo;Black Week&rdquo; section shows, however, that in all likelihood the merchant vessels involved complied with their legal obligations and did everything they possibly could to rescue the passengers in distress. While it could appear that only the ruthless smugglers who overcrowded unseaworthy boats to the point of collapse are to blame, the report focuses on the deeper responsibilities of EU agencies and policy makers. It demonstrates that the latter&rsquo;s policy of retreat from state-led Search and Rescue (SAR) operations shifted the burden of extremely dangerous search and rescue operations onto large merchant ships, which are ill-fitted to conduct them. In this way, EU agencies and policy makers knowingly created the conditions that led to massive loss of life in the April shipwrecks.</p>

				<div class="box">
					<h3><span class="h3-heading">About the report</span></h3>
				</div>

				<p>The following report, produced by Forensic Oceanography &ndash; a research team based within the Forensic Architecture agency at Goldsmiths (University of London) that specialises in the use forensic techniques and cartography to reconstruct cases of deaths at sea &ndash; in collaboration with WatchTheMed and in the framework of the ESRC-supported &ldquo;Precarious Trajectories&rdquo; research project, seeks to understand the conditions that made these events possible.</p>

				<p>It does so by mobilising a vast array of methodologies and techniques. First, the report offers, through a series of visualizations, diagrams and figures, a detailed spatio-temporal reconstruction of various cases of shipwrecks. This work was an exercise in the culling of disparate data that was eventually recombined in an effort to assemble a coherent spatial narrative of the chain of events. The reconstructions provided by the report are in fact based on numerous sources, in particular survivors&rsquo; testimonies, distress signals, Search and Rescue (SAR) reports provided by Frontex, Automatic Information System (AIS) vessel tracking data, judicial documents obtained from public prosecutors&rsquo; offices in Sicily investigating these cases, and photographs taken during the events by rescue teams. At times, elements of information were also extracted from secondary sources such as news reports and human rights reports by international organizations such as Amnesty International.</p>

				<p>The policy decisions that led to these shipwrecks, however, sought precisely to keep state-operated assets at a distance from the area in which these were occurring. Focusing exclusively on the reconstruction of the events, then, would not have allowed for an accurate description of the mechanisms of this form of killing by omission. Therefore, in addition to case reconstruction, the report undertook an analysis that could be characterized as a &ldquo;policy forensics&rdquo;. This consisted of a comprehensive textual analysis of various technical assessments produced by Frontex, official statements by policy makers and EU officials, minutes of operational meetings between Frontex and other member states agencies, and transcripts of debates in the European Parliament and in its Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) committee. This endeavour was necessary, first of all, in order to gain a fine-grained understanding of the successive institutional steps that led to the retreat of state-led SAR operations. Secondly, it has allowed us to assess with precision the degree of knowledge concerning the risks to migrants&rsquo; lives the actors taking these decisions possessed. On this basis, the report points to the responsibility of the various agencies and individuals that took those decisions.</p>

				<p>Finally, the report seeks to attend to the materialisation of these policies at sea, in terms of: the operational zones, operational logics and practices of state actors; how these policy shifts affected the practices of other actors operating at sea, such as smugglers and merchant ships; and the conditions and danger of migrants&rsquo; crossings. Here key sources were: spatial analysis of operational zones; interviews with state officials (the Italian Coast Guard, Customs Police and Frontex) concerning their operations at sea; and statistical data referring to migrant arrivals, deaths and SAR operations.</p>

				<p>The diversity of sources and types of data required the report to draw upon the methodologies and expertise of a variety of disciplines. The material has thus been analysed in collaboration with experts in the relevant fields of geographic information science, vessel tracking technologies, image forensics, oceanography, statistical analysis, EU policy, international law and migration studies.</p>


				<div class="box">
					<h3><span class="h3-heading">Report outline</span></h3>
				</div>

				<p>In the first section, entitled &ldquo;Ending Mare Nostrum&rdquo;, by dissecting minutes of political meetings and previously unreleased operational documents, the report reconstructs the institutional process that unfolded after the announcement of the Italian government&rsquo;s intention to discontinue the military-humanitarian operation Mare Nostrum (MN). The latter, which began in October 2013, had deployed unprecedented means to rescue migrants in distress close to the Libyan shores, but in the summer of 2014 had attracted increasing criticism for allegedly constituting a pull factor and causing more deaths at sea. The report counters these claims by demonstrating that both increased crossings and deaths had begun before the commencement of MN, and thus seeks to explain these processes by attending to a broader range of regional and political factors.</p>
				
				<p>We then reconstruct the institutional processes and the operational decision-making that led from Italy&rsquo;s announcement that it would seek the EU&rsquo;s taking over of the responsibilities of MN to the launch, on 1 November 2014, of the Triton operation. The latter, led by Frontex, the European border agency, deployed more limited assets in an area further away from the Libyan coast and did not have rescue as their operational priority. Through operational documents and meeting minutes, the report demonstrates that EU member states, political bodies and agencies &ndash; in particular Frontex &ndash; knew that the ending of MN would cause increased risk for migrants and ultimately lead to more deaths at sea, but discarded this information to prioritize the aim of deterrence.</p>
				
				<p>In the second section, &ldquo;After Mare Nostrum: January to March 2015&rdquo;, the report analyses the effects these policy decisions had on the practices of actors at sea and the danger of crossing. It does so through forensic case reconstruction, together with spatial and statistical analysis. As the reports demonstrates, the positioning of Frontex assets far away from Libyan coasts and their exclusive focus on border control left an increasingly dangerous gap in SAR capabilities. While this retreat was vocally defended by Frontex Director of Operations Division, Klaus R&ouml;sler, in a letter to the Italian authorities that we have now accessed, its deadly effects became apparent in the first months of 2015 through a series of incidents that are analysed in detail.</p>
				
				<p>These incidents show how an increasing number of migrants were left to drift for several hours or even days before being detected and before rescue means, now located much further away from the area where most SAR events were happening, managed to reach them. Moreover, the report also shows how the Italian Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centre (MRCC) in charge of SAR operations in the Sicily Channel sought to fill this SAR vacuum by increasingly calling upon merchant ships transiting in the area to carry out rescue operations. However, merchant ships are unfit to carry out the large-scale and particularly dangerous rescue operations involving migrants, as was clearly indicated by the shipwreck of 3 March 2015, in which 30 migrants lost their lives when their boat overturned in the excitement that followed the sighting of the supply vessel that was approaching to rescue them. These signals that indicated that continued crossings and increasing deaths were materialising were not heeded to.</p>
				
				<p>In the third section, &ldquo;April&rsquo;s Black Week&rdquo;, the report reconstructs in detail the 12 and 18 April 2015 shipwrecks in which more than 1200 people died. While it could appear then that only the ruthless smugglers who overcrowded unseaworthy boats to the point of collapse are to blame, in light of the sequence of events and policy decisions we have reconstructed, we can see another level of political responsibility emerging. The EU&rsquo;s policy of retreat of state-operated rescue at sea left in fact ill-adapted commercial vessels to bear most of the responsibility for rescuing and this, in turn, led to <em>assistance becoming deadly.</em> Death by rescue was thus the outcome of the EU&rsquo;s policies of non-assistance. Relying on statistical analysis, we further show that the predictions of human rights organisations turned out to be true: ending Mare Nostrum did not lead to less crossings, only to more deaths at sea and a higher mortality rate.</p>
				
				<p>In the fourth section, &ldquo;After the April Shipwrecks&rdquo;, we show the EU was forced to re-extend its operations at sea to respond to public outcry these shipwrecks caused. This section describes the main policy shifts, most notably, the extension of Triton operational area as well as the launch of the military operation EUNAVFOR MED, both of which continued to prioritize security concerns over saving lives. Thanks also to the intervention of a veritable civilian rescue flotilla launched and the sharp decrease in the mobilisation of commercial vessels for the purpose of rescue, the mortality rate returned to the levels registered during MN. The section ends by stressing that the only factor that managed to bring the mortality rate down significantly was the opening of the so-called &ldquo;Balkan route&rdquo;, which allowed more and more migrants to change their route as of May 2015 from the central to the eastern Mediterranean, that is from a longer and much more dangerous route to a much shorter and relatively safer stretch of sea.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, in the &ldquo;Conclusions and Recommendations&rdquo;, the report summarises its findings concerning the responsibilities involved in the twin April shipwrecks. We further argue that while the current exclusionary migration regime stands, continuing to force migrants to resort to smugglers in order to to reach EU territory, proactive state-led SAR operations are necessary. However, because even in the presence of the record means deployed by the Mare Nostrum operation, the danger of crossing remained high, this are sufficient to bring the deaths of migrants to an end. Only a fundamental reorientation from a policy that seeks to select and block migrants&rsquo; movements to one that would grant legal and safe passage, thereby making both smugglers and the very need to rescue migrants at sea obsolete, would stop the list of more than 20,000 recorded cases of deaths at sea since the beginning of the 1990 from growing ever longer.</p>

						Ending Mare Nostrum
					</span></h2></div>
						<p>
						Forensic Architecture, a research team based at Goldsmiths, University of London, specializes in urban and architectural analysis of conflict. In the context of research for this report, its methodology was a response to the limitations of site access. 
						</p>
						<div class="h3-heading-box">
						<h3><span class="h3-heading">
						SITE SURVEY 
						</span></h3>
						</div>
						<p>
						Forensic Architecture’s core team could not access Gaza because of the same restrictions faced by Amnesty International. It therefore worked with a number of field researchers and photographers who documented sites where incidents took place. The photographers followed basic protocols for forensic photography. These included, where possible, step photography, the introduction of scale indicators to each frame, panoramic documentation, GPS location, and the keeping of a handwritten diary of description related to each photograph. 
						</p>
						<div class="h3-heading-box">
						<h3><span class="h3-heading">
						WITNESS TESTIMONIES
						</span></h3>
						</div>
						<p>
						On several occasions Forensic Architecture requested additions to testimonies collected by Amnesty International, primarily to clarify spatial information. These additions included asking witnesses to mark their locations on maps, plans or satellite images. Forensic Architecture located elements of the witness testimonies in space and time and plotted the movement of witnesses through a three-dimensional model of urban spaces. It also modelled and animated the testimony of several witnesses, combining spatial information obtained from separate testimonies and other sources in order to reconstruct incidents.

						SATELLITE IMAGE ANALYSIS 
						</span></h3>
						</div>
						<p>
						The Pléiades Earth-observing satellite constellation, operated by the French space agency, CNES, has been collecting images at a resolution up to 0.5 metres a pixel since 2012. While this level of detail is now common for commercial satellite images, American commercial satellite companies such as DigitalGlobe are obligated to degrade any imagery taken over Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories to 1 metre due to agreements between Israel and the USA.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="The agreement dates back to 1998. See, for example, Shawn L. Twing, “U.S. Bans High-Resolution Imagery of Israel”, <i>Washington Report on Middle East Affairs</a>, September 1998, <a href='http://www.wrmea.org/1998-september/u.s.-bans-high-resolution-imagery-of-israel.html' target='_blank'>http://www.wrmea.org/1998-september/u.s.-bans-high-resolution-imagery-of-israel.html</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> The Gaza/Israel conflict of 2014 is the first Israeli-Palestinian conflict in which such high resolution satellite imagery was made publicly available (and thus obtained by Amnesty International and Forensic Architecture). “Before” and “after” Pléiades satellite images were used to assess changes in site condition at attack sites under analysis. The “before” satellite image served as a baseline from which any disturbance to the natural or built-up environment may be identified by comparison with the “after” image.
						</p>
						<p>
						Three satellite images are relevant to this study, dated 30 July, 1 August and 14 August. Each image extends westward from the Gaza-Egypt border to encompass central Rafah and was acquired around 11.39am when the satellite passed over the western Levant. The 1 August image, in particular, captures a rarely seen overview of a moment only two and a half hours after the ceasefire collapsed, at the heart of the operation.
						</p>
						<p>
						Forensic Architecture’s interpretation of satellite imagery was corroborated by John Pines, a satellite image analyst and former intelligence officer in the British military.
						</p>
						<p>
						Further analysis of Pléiades and other satellite data was undertaken by Dr. Jamon Van Den Hoek, Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and incoming Assistant Professor and Geospatial Intelligence Leader in the Geography programme at Oregon State University. Dr Van Den Hoek carried out an automated change analysis using panchromatic and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data based on Pléiades images as well as open-access NASA Landsat-8 satellite images, which cover all of Gaza. These "change" maps were used to identify building and road damage, locations of craters, and crops or trees destroyed when vehicles were driven through fields. Studied individually and in relation to each other, satellite images provided a useful resource to reconstruct the force movement, blasts and other events of 1-4 August 2014.

						MEDIA ANALYSIS

						Forensic Architecture scanned a large number of Arabic, Hebrew and English-language sources, many of which were also consulted by Amnesty International. They included Palestinian and Israeli media sources, Palestinian social media sources and photographs and video clips from photographic agencies and image banks.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Key sources include: Palestinian media sources such as Ma’an, <i>Al-Rai</i>, Al Watan Voice, Quds Radio 102.7 FM; Palestinian social media sources, including Twitter and Facebook accounts; Israeli media sites such as Walla, NRG, Ynet and <i>Haaretz</i>, Israeli TV Channel 2 and Channel 10 (many of these sources included interviews with Israeli military staff, which is subject to censorship by the IDF and has been independently corroborated when possible); photographs and video clips from photographic agencies and image banks such as Getty, Reuters, Corbis and Anadolu Agency, as well as from AP, ITN and CBS." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> They also included official Israeli and Palestinian statements appearing on IDF and Hamas websites; accounts by Palestinian NGOs, such as the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) and Al-Haq; testimonies given by Israeli soldiers to Breaking the Silence and published on their website; video recordings from the local ambulance services in Gaza; hospital logs which document calls to the emergency office; photographs and videos provided by civilians and activists who witnessed events.

						VIDEO TO SPACE
						</span></h3>
						</div>
						<p>
						While a few independently shot videos were uploaded onto social media during the 2008-9 Gaza/Israel conflict, Forensic Architecture retrieved a comparatively large amount of audiovisual material on social media in relation to the 2014 Gaza/Israel conflict. Photographs and videos taken by both journalists and citizens captured large amounts of spatial information about environments in which events were unfolding, including the architectural layout of sites, the location and the time of day. Video stills were collaged together to create a panoramic view of space. Working back from distinctive architectural features – for example, a water tower, a high building, a crossroads or a football pitch – Forensic Architecture located still images within the satellite images and three-dimensional models.

						GEOSYNCING 
						</span></h3>
						</div>
						<p>
						Geosyncing refers to the establishment of space-time coordinates of an event. To reconstruct the events of 1-4 August, Forensic Architecture employed digital maps and models to locate evidence such as oral description, photography, video and satellite imagery in space and time. As such the media were used to reconstruct events, and to verify findings by cross-referencing various sources. When the metadata in an image or a clip file was intact, Forensic Architecture identified it by using Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Bridge. The geosyncing is in this case a straightforward process, undertaken on software platforms such as QGIS. However, material from social media often came without metadata, or with the metadata damaged or inaccurate. In the absence of digital time markers Forensic Architecture used analogue or “physical clocks” – time indicators in the image – such as shadow and smoke plumes analysis to locate sources in space and time. 
						</p>
						<div class="h3-heading-box">
						  <h3><span class="h3-heading">
						METADATA ANALYSIS
						</span></h3>
						</div>
						<p>
						Photographs and videos sourced from social media, activists and civilians on the ground often did not have accurate metadata, as cameras are not always set to the right time and date. Forensic Architecture investigated the accuracy of metadata by corroborating the footage with other verified events. Furthermore, Forensic Architecture was able to correct wrongly set metadata, by marking the time difference between the images in a sequence of photographs, and synching the sequence with a recognized and timed event.

						<div class="h3-heading-box">
						  <h3><span class="h3-heading">
						SHADOW ANALYSIS
						</span></h3>
						</div>
						<p>
						Forensic Architecture built a digital model of Rafah to locate witnesses and photographs in space, as well as to use the model as a digital sundial; all standard architectural modelling software currently come with shadow simulators. To establish the time of a photograph Forensic Architecture matched these digital shadows with shadows captured in a photograph or a video. A match would provide information about the location, orientation and time of the image representation. Another use for shadow is that the length, seen on satellite imagery, provides information about the height of built volumes. 
						</p>
						<p>
						In order to time video footage through the observed shadows, Forensic Architecture undertook a threefold process. First it located the image or still from the video geographically and calculated the camera angle. Using three-dimensional modelling and animation software – such as Cinema 4D – that offers camera calibration features, Forensic Architecture then analysed the perspective and lens distortion of the found footage and matched it to a digital camera perspective. It finally ran a digital shadow simulation, by inputting the location coordinates and seasonal information to find the matching shadows and determine the time of capture of the footage.  
						</p>
						<p>
						In many cases the process was supplemented by an analogue shadow calculation, by architecturally analysing a one-point or two-point perspective, drawing the featuring buildings and shadows into a plan and using an analogue sun diagram to calculate the time of capture. This process is extremely sensitive to measurements and could only be employed with regard to a small portion of the footage, where shadows are clear and orientation can be clearly defined. When used this method was corroborated by other evidence or was used to support alternative time indications. The margin of error is five to 10 minutes.

						PLUME AND SMOKE CLOUD ARCHITECTURE 
						</span></h3>
						</div>
						<p>
						After a bomb blasts its smoke plume goes through several distinct phases. The plume forms into a mushroom cloud that slowly dissipates. Studying photographic representation of plumes, Forensic Architecture estimated how long after a strike the photograph was taken. Each explosion from air-dropped munitions results in a smoke plume whose form is unique to the moment and the strike. In this way, Forensic Architecture undertook detailed morphological analysis to identify the same strike in different pieces of footage and to synchronize the footage based on the phase of plume growth being observed. This analysis therefore offered a way of linking evidence together in space and time. The process of synchronization and triangulation helped reconstruct the space and time sequence of unfolding events. Forensic Architecture also measured and compared the size of plumes as captured in different media sources, to compare the plume caused by unknown strikes with known ones.

				Amnesty International has been unable to send a delegation of researchers to visit the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the conflict in July 2014. The Israeli authorities have refused, up to the time of writing this report, to allow Amnesty International and other international human rights monitors to enter the Gaza Strip through the Erez crossing with Israel, despite the organization’s repeated requests since the beginning of the conflict to do so. The Egyptian authorities have also not granted Amnesty International permission to enter the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, despite the organization’s repeated requests to do so.

				Amnesty International has consequently had to carry out research remotely, supported by two fieldworkers based in Gaza who were contracted to work with the organization for periods of several weeks. They travelled extensively within the Strip, visiting many of the sites described in this report, some more than once, as soon as possible after the attacks took place, interviewing dozens of victims and eyewitnesses and taking photos and videos of the sites. The organization consulted on the interpretation of photos and videos with military experts. It extensively reviewed relevant statements by the Israeli military and other official bodies. Amnesty International also studied relevant documentation produced by UN agencies, Palestinian, Israeli and other non-governmental organizations, local officials, media, and others who monitored the conflict, and consulted with them as needed.

				Despite these efforts, the lack of access for Amnesty International’s researchers, as well as military personnel who would have accompanied them, has clearly hindered the work of Amnesty International, as it has for other human rights organizations wishing to document violations of international law in the Gaza Strip. First-hand examination of sites that have been attacked – both in damaged buildings and elsewhere – help monitors assess how, with what and why something was targeted, but the evidence disappears quickly. Suffering from a great shortage of living space, residents of the Gaza Strip started almost immediately after the conflict to clear up the rubble and use what could be salvaged to rebuild their homes, as after other recent conflicts. Fragments of munitions which would have helped identify which weapons were used have been carried off from the rubble of destroyed homes by civil defence workers, souvenir hunters and others.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="For instance, some individuals picked up fragments of munitions as souvenirs or to use to make practical or decorative objects.

				Governments who wish to hide their violations of human rights from the outside world have frequently banned Amnesty International from accessing the places in which they have been committed. Although Amnesty International researchers have consistently been able to access Israel and the occupied West Bank, they have not been allowed by the Israeli government to enter the Gaza Strip through the Erez crossing since June 2012. The UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, which was set up by the UN Human Rights Council and reported in 2009 on violations of international law by all sides during Israel’s Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip, criticized this policy, stating: “The Mission is of the view that the presence of international human rights monitors would have been of great assistance in not only investigating and reporting but also in the publicizing of events on the ground.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, <i>Human Rights in Palestine and other Occupied Arab Territories: Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict</a> (A/HRC/12/48), 23 September 2009, para. 1734, <a href='unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/25184E52D3E5CDBA8525763200532E73' target='_blank'>unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/25184E52D3E5CDBA8525763200532E73</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  It added: “The presence of international human rights monitors is likely to have a deterrent effect, dissuading parties to a conflict from engaging in violations of international law.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, <i>Human Rights in Palestine and other Occupied Arab Territories: Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict</a> (A/HRC/12/48), 23 September 2009, para. 1747, <a href='unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/25184E52D3E5CDBA8525763200532E73' target='_blank'>unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/25184E52D3E5CDBA8525763200532E73</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

				On 8 October 2014, Amnesty International sent a memorandum to the three Israeli mechanisms investigating aspects of Operation Protective Edge – the State Comptroller, the army’s General Staff Mechanism for Fact-Finding Assessments, and the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee – as well as to the army’s Chief of General Staff, the Prime Minister and the Ministers of Defense, Justice and Foreign Affairs. The memorandum set out some of the concerns Amnesty International had about the conduct of Israeli forces during Operation Protective Edge and requested responses to these. It requested information on what specific factors were taken into account prior to the deployment of weapons and munitions which have indiscriminate effects when used in densely populated areas, such as mortars and artillery, and on what concrete steps were taken by the IDF to avoid their use in situations where civilians would be at risk. It also requested clarification regarding the criteria used by the IDF to assess the risk to civilians when selecting pre-identified targets for attack, at what point in advance of the proposed attack and at what level of seniority this was done. It asked for details of how the decision was made to attack civilian objects, such as hospitals, ambulances, schools, homes, and other essential infrastructure, on what criteria and at what level of command seniority. It also requested information on the precautions taken in planning and executing attacks on military targets, including Palestinian fighters, to ensure that any harm likely to be caused to civilians in carrying out such attacks would not be disproportionate. It also asked for details of evidence the IDF might have of violations by Hamas and Palestinian armed groups.

				In November 2014 a reply was received from the State Comptroller which described the focus of their inquiry and accepted Amnesty International’s proposal for a meeting. Amnesty International wrote back to the State Comptroller to seek a date for such a meeting but had received no reply before this report was finalized. The organization has received no other response to the memorandum it sent in October 2014.
				</p>

				On 15 July 2015, Amnesty International addressed letters to each of the authorities it had contacted on 8 October 2014 to remind them of the outstanding requests to them and to request additional information on cases highlighted in this report. It reiterated its wish to meet the authorities, either before or after the publication of this report.
