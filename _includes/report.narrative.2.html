				<p>The Mare Nostrum (MN) operation was launched in response to the tragic shipwreck that occurred on 3 October 2013. On the morning of that day, a boat carrying more than 500 migrants sank less than one kilometre from the coast of Lampedusa, causing the death of at least 366 people.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See WatchTheMed, &ldquo;At least 366 people dead in wreck 1 km from Lampedusa&rdquo;, 24 December 2013, <a href='http://watchthemed.net/reports/view/31'>http://watchthemed.net/reports/view/31</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016). It is often forgotten that this shipwreck was quickly followed by another one on October 11. In that case, as the investigation conducted by the WatchTheMed network and journalist Fabrizio Gatti revealed, the deployment of rescue to a boat carrying over 400 people that had started taking in water after it had been shot by a Libyan vessel was delayed for over 5 hours due to conflicts of responsibility between the Italian and Maltese Coast Guards. Rescue vessels arrived one hour after the boat had sunk and more than 200 people had died. See WatchTheMed, &ldquo;Over 200 die after shooting by Libyan vessel and delay in rescue&rdquo;, 29 November 2013, <a href='http://www.watchthemed.net/reports/view/32'>www.watchthemed.net/reports/view/32</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> The public outcry that followed this event forced EU politicians to respond. Between 7 and 8 October 2013, ministers gathered at the Justice and Home Affairs meeting of the European Council in Luxemburg &ldquo;held an exchange of views on the <em>actions that are needed to avoid such tragedies</em>&rdquo;.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Council of the European Union, Press Release following the 3260th Council meeting,</p>

				<p>In the following days and weeks, however, it became clear that the &ldquo;actions&rdquo; and &ldquo;tools&rdquo; identified by the EU to avoid massive loss of lives at sea would be geared only in the direction of strengthening border control, not rescue at sea. In the immediate aftermath of the 3 October shipwreck, the EU President, José Manuel Barroso, announced the final implementation of the EU-wide Eurosur surveillance system and the reinforcement of Frontex, the EU border control agency.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="European Commission, &ldquo;Statement by President Barroso following his visit to Lampedusa&rdquo;, 9 October 2013, <a href='http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-792_en.htm'>http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-792_en.htm</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>


				<p>This direction continued to be reaffirmed over the next six months of successive reports and meetings between the different EU bodies. During these meetings, no common measures granting migrants legal access to EU territory and safe transport, would even be considered. Such measures, if initiated, would end precarious means of crossing, and importantly, the necessity to resort to smugglers. Moreover, EU member states and institutions made no substantial efforts to support the rescue of migrants at sea. Assessing this institutional process that unfolded after October 2013, Amnesty International&rsquo;s Secretary General, Salil Shetty, stated on 21 January 2014:</p>

				<p>The Italian government decided to adopt a different strategy and, in light of migrants&rsquo; increasing crossings and deaths, Italy prioritized rescue at sea. On 18 October 2013, the Italian government single-handedly launched what has been by far the largest &ldquo;humanitarian and security&rdquo; operation in the Mediterranean: <em>Mare Nostrum</em>.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="<a href='http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/generalnews/2013/10/15/Immigration-Italy-launches-Mare-Nostrum-400-saved_9466386.html'>ANSAmed, &ldquo;Immigration: Italy launches Mare Nostrum, 400 more saved&rdquo;, <em>ANSAMed</em>, 15 October 2013, http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/generalnews/2013/10/15/Immigration-Italy-launches-Mare-Nostrum-400-saved_9466386.html</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016).

With MN, rescue activities reached an unprecedented expansion in their spatial deployment. Until then, search and rescue (SAR) operations in the (undeclared) Libyan SAR zone were a rare event and the majority of migrants&rsquo; boats reached Italian and Maltese coasts on their own or were simply &ldquo;escorted&rdquo; for the last few nautical miles.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="This has been the case in particular until September 2011, when the island of Lampedusa was declared a &ldquo;non-safe port&rdquo;. After that decision, rescue operations in the high seas&rsquo; south of Lampedusa became increasingly common but only the rule with Mare Nostrum. During several interviews conducted between 2011 and 2015, the Italian Coast Guard and border police confirmed to us this information." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> During MN, military vessels were continuously positioned in close proximity of the Libyan coast, and intercepted and rescued every migrants&rsquo; boat that they encountered. Moreover, while disembarkation had constituted a thorny problem for many years<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See &ldquo;Background&rdquo; section." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>, with MN, migrants rescued in the central Mediterranean were taken to Italy by default. MN thus constituted a clear shift away from the reluctance of states to carry out rescue operations and the criminalisation of those who engaged in this, which had led to cases of non-assistance in the past.</p>

        %}

				<p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">MN, however, had ambivalent results from a humanitarian point of view and became increasingly contested, both within Italy and at the EU level.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="In this report, we consider exclusively criticism towards MN that concerns the latter&rsquo;s influence on deaths at sea. For a discussion of other levels of criticism, see Charles Heller and Lorenzo Pezzani, &ldquo;Ebbing and Flowing: The EU&rsquo;s Shifting Practices of (Non-)Assistance and Bordering in a Time of Crisis&rdquo;, <em>Near Futures Online</em>, no. 1, January 2016, <a href='http://nearfuturesonline.org/ebbing-and-flowing-the-eus-shifting-practices-of-non-assistance-and-bordering-in-a-time-of-crisis/'>http://nearfuturesonline.org/ebbing-and-flowing-the-eus-shifting-practices-of-non-assistance-and-bordering-in-a-time-of-crisis/</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Critics of MN argued in particular that the operation did not constitute a viable response to the drama of migrants dying at sea because (1) it constituted a &ldquo;pull factor&rdquo; and (2) it inadvertently led to more deaths instead of saving more lives, since it led to more crossings and smugglers, as a consequence of its presence, started sending migrants off in increasingly precarious conditions. While it is a fact that <em>during</em> Mare Nostrum&rsquo;s period of operation a record number of migrants arrived on EU shores and a record number of deaths were reported, an analysis of migration patterns <em>before, during</em> and <em>after</em> the operation shows that MN was not the root cause of the trends that unfolded during this period.</p>

					<h3><span class="h3-heading">
						THE &ldquo;PULL FACTOR&rdquo; CRITICSM
					</span></h3>
				</div>


				<p>One criticism of MN was that it led to an increase in the number of arrivals on Italian shores. The availability of a great number of assets dedicated to rescue operations close to the Libyan coast, it was argued, was actually encouraging more migrants to start the crossing on unseaworthy vessels and to put their lives in the hands of unscrupulous smugglers. As a result, the argument continued, to curb arrivals it was necessary to end MN. Politicians across the EU such as the UK Foreign Office Minister Lady Anelay echoed the Italian xenophobic Lega Nord party in denouncing search and rescue operations as a &ldquo;pull factor&rdquo;, thereby justifying her government&rsquo;s refusal to fund the continuation of the operation.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="On Wednesday 15 October 2014, in UK Parliament, Lady Anelay stated: &ldquo;We do not support planned search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. We believe that they create an unintended &ldquo;pull factor&rdquo;, encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths&rdquo;, <a href='http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldhansrd/text/141015w0001.htm'>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldhansrd/text/141015w0001.htm</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>


				<p>At first glance, the data on arrivals during 2014 seems to confirm this argument. Arrivals in Italy went from slightly over 40,000 in 2013 to over 170,000 in 2014. Looking at 2013 trends more closely, however, we can see that the increase in the number of crossing had started well before MN. This tendency was indicated by Frontex itself, which in its risk analysis regarding the July to September 2013 period (i.e., before the beginning of MN), observed the most significant increase in crossings since 2011.</p>

				<p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">Two main factors can be mentioned to explain the increase recorded in 2013, which would continue to mark 2014 as well. The first one is the Syrian exodus, which in the summer of 2013 went, as a UNHCR report tellingly put it, &ldquo;from slow boil to breaking point&rdquo;.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), &ldquo;From slow boil to breaking point: A real-time evaluation of UNHCR&rsquo;s response to the Syrian refugee emergency&rdquo;, July 2013, <a href='https://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/download.php?id=2558'>https://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/download.php?id=2558</a> (accessed January 18, 2016)" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Until the summer of 2013, Syrians had mostly sought refuge in other areas within their own country or in neighbouring countries (Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt).<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Ibid. and Jeff Crisp, &ldquo;Syria&rsquo;s refugees: a global responsibility&rdquo;, <em>Opendemocracy</em>, 30 June 2015, <a href='http://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/news/syria2019s-refugees-a-global-responsibility'>http://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/news/syria2019s-refugees-a-global-responsibility</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> However, the increasing numbers of refugees quickly exceeded both the capacity of humanitarian organisations and of neighbouring countries, which began reintroducing visa obligations for Syrians.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="This was the case of Egypt, for example after the July 2013 <em>coup </em>against the Morsi-led government, see Ibrahim Awad, &ldquo;Population Movements in the Aftermath of the Arab Awakening: The Syrian Refugee Crisis between Regional Factors and State Interest&rdquo;, In Omar Grech and Monika Wohlfeld, 2014 (eds.). <em>Migration in the Mediterranean: Human Rights, Security and Development Perspectives</em>. Malta: MEDAC." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Over 2013, as the civil war became more and more entrenched, the Syrian exodus increased markedly &ndash; with the number of Syrian refugees doubling from one million in March 2013 to two million in September 2013.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="UNHCR data." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> As a result, Syrians became increasingly likely to seek refugee ever further, including by crossing the sea from Libya. This trend would continue apace throughout 2014.</p>


				<p>The second key factor was the increasing level of violence that resulted from the progressive collapse of the transition process in Libya. The process of political fragmentation led to mounting violence that affected Libyan society at large but in had a particularly grave influence on migrants, who were subjected to multiple forms of violence at different moments of their trajectory.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Amnesty International, <em>Libya is full of Cruelty: Stories of Abduction, Sexual Violence and Abuse from Migrants and Refugees,</em> London, Mai 2015, <a href='https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde19/1578/2015/en/'>https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde19/1578/2015/en/</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016).

				<div class="box">
		          <p class="emphasized-text">
		          The intensification of crossings can thus not be attributed solely to the presence of MN, since they resulted from deeper regional political factors that were leading to this trend <em>before</em> MN. As we will discuss in more detail in the &ldquo;After Mare Nostrum&rdquo; section, the fact that MN was not the major cause is further confirmed by the comparable scale of crossings <em>after </em>MN.

						THE &ldquo;INCREASING DEATH&rdquo; CRITICSM

				</div>


				<p>The other main criticism put forth to justify ending support for MN was that the operation increased the danger of the crossings, as it prompted a shift in smugglers&rsquo; practices. Smugglers, it was argued, were relying on the presence of MN to operate rescue at an early stage and were thus providing subpar crossing conditions, thus provoking more deaths. Frontex&rsquo;s executive director, Gil Arias, epitomized this position in his answer to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) of the European Parliament on 4 September 2014:</p>

<!-- QUOTE -->
				<div class="quote">
	                <div class="quote-text">
	                    “I&rsquo;m afraid of saying that it has been a pull factor but obviously the smugglers have abused of the proximity of the operation to the Libyan coast to, on the one hand to put more people on the sea, with the assumption that they will be rescued very soon, and this also made it cheaper for them, as I said, because they put and they are putting less fuel, less food, less water on the vessel, which at the same time also increases the risk for the migrants.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="European Parliament, Hearing of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), 4 September 2014, <a href='http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ep-live/en/committees/video?event=20140904-0930-COMMITTEE-LIBE'>http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ep-live/en/committees/video?event=20140904-0930-COMMITTEE-LIBE</a> (last accessed January 18, 2016).

	                </div>
		        </div>


				<p>Let&rsquo;s analyse this claim. First, it is a fact that while MN allowed for a record number of people to be rescued, a record number of 3,186 deaths were also reported in the central Mediterranean in 2014 alone.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="<p><a href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23">[23]</a> IOM data, see <a href=#>annex</a>.</p>" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> During the period of Mare Nostrum&rsquo;s operation, then, the crossing did not become less dangerous and the mortality rate actually slightly increased from 15/1,000 in 2013 to 18.4/1,000 in 2014, with a peak in the summer.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See statistical annex for 2014. For 2013, see Philippe Fargues and Sara Bonfanti, &ldquo;When the best option is a leaky boat: why migrants risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean and what Europe is doing about it&rdquo;,&nbsp;<em>EUI. </em>Bruxelles: Migration Policy Centre, 2014. Philippe Fargues and Anna Di Bartolomeo, &ldquo;Drowned Europe&rdquo;, <em>EUI. </em>Bruxelles: Migration Policy Centre, 2015." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> So while MN did not make the crossing substantially more dangerous, as its critics held, it is also true that it did not make it <em>less</em> dangerous. It is also a documented fact that smuggling practices evolved <em>during </em>the time of the MN operation, and partly adapting to its presence. It is certainly likely that this shift contributed to making the crossing more dangerous, leading to &ldquo;a new strategy of deliberately meeting, instead of bypassing controls, but also using even more <em>unseaworthy boats, loading them ever more, and providing less food and fuel</em>&rdquo;.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Philippe Fargues and Anna Di Bartolomeo, &ldquo;Drowned Europe&rdquo;, <em>EUI. </em>Bruxelles: Migration Policy Centre, 2015, pp. 5.

Brussels: European Foundation for Democracy, 2015, pp. 73-87. Empirical evidence collected by Porsia and Frontex confirms once again these facts. In terms of the unseaworthyness of boats, the interviews by Porsia indicate that, while a shortage of wooden boats had begun at the end of 2013, with SAR operations occurring closer to the Libyan coast, &ldquo;smugglers also began to retrieve the boats abandoned by the Italian Navy after the rescue operations and re-use them for as many as six further trips&rdquo; which evidently affected the seaworthiness of the vessels (Porsia 2015, p. 77). In addition, the increasing tendency to extreme overloading of boats is also documented by Frontex data on the number of people per boat (see below)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup></p>

		          The problem with the argument outlined by Frontex&rsquo;s executive director, Gil Arias, however, is that such a claim assumes a causal chain between MN, smuggling practices and increased risk for migrants. Such an understanding however is insufficient to explain the rise of deaths and slight rise in mortality. First of all, shifts in the practices of smugglers attributed to MN emerged before MN. Secondly, there were factors other than smugglers&rsquo; practices that contributed to the rising death toll.

				<p>Smugglers in Libya had been operating a well-established business since the beginning of the century thanks to their stable relations with the Qaddafi regime.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Paola Monzini, Nourhan Abdel Aziz, Ferruccio Pastore, &ldquo;The Changing Dynamics of Cross-border Human Smuggling and Trafficking in the Mediterranean&rdquo;, <em>Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI)</em>, 2015, Rome, pp. 1-75." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> The fall of the Libyan regime, however, led to changes in smuggling practices that have made the conditions of the crossing more dangerous. In particular, as Nancy Porsia details in her report included in the annex, the practices of smugglers had already started to considerably change <em>during 2013</em> in parallel to the dwindling hopes for a stable and prosperous post-revolutionary future. The Libyan political fragmentation led in fact to more volatile relations between smugglers and the factions in control of particular areas but also allowed new actors &ndash; who offered lower prices but did not always possess the willingness or the know-how to organise safe crossings &ndash; to enter the smuggling market.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="(see Porsia in <a href=#>annex</a>)" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> This in turn meant that to guarantee a profitable margin, smugglers had to resort to subpar navigation equipment or to loading more migrants on board their unsafe boats. In its 19 November 2013 report for the &ldquo;Task Force Mediterranean&rdquo;, the European External Action Service (EEAS) noted the trend towards &ldquo;increasing numbers of migrants on the boats, which are overloaded and/or unseaworthy, leading to an increasing risk of fatalities especially along the central Mediterranean route&rdquo;.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="European External Action Service (EEAS), <em>Migration Flows in the Southern Neighbourhood and their External Relations Perspective &ndash;Possible Avenues for Dialogue and Cooperation with Partner Countries, including Options for a CSDP Operation</em>, 19 November 2013, <a href='http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;f=ST%2016394%202013%20INIT'>http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;f=ST%2016394%202013%20INIT</a> (last accessed January 18, 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> As this document was produced only days after the start of MN, it cannot describe a shift brought about by MN, but rather a pre-existing situation. This tendency only increased in the following months and, as Porsia notes, &ldquo;as of late 2013, the standards of the smugglers&rsquo; service drastically dropped: very often the migrants were put at sea with no life jacket, no satellite phone or GPS&rdquo;.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Nancy Porsia, &ldquo;The Exploitation of Migration Routes to Europe: Human Trafficking Through Areas of Libya Affected by Fundamentalism&rdquo;, In <em>Libya&rsquo;s Fight For Survival</em>.

				<p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The changes in the practices of smugglers and the increase in the danger of crossing were thus well underway <em>before</em> MN was launched and cannot be attributed to the latter. Rather, it seems that MN could not make up for and may have exacerbated a shift in the practices of smugglers that was already underway. This shift would probably have occurred anyway without MN as a result of the combination of the increasing number of people willing to cross the sea and the volatility of the Libyan context mentioned above. The peak in the mortality rate recorded in October 2013 provides an indication of the danger migrants might have continued to face without MN &ndash; a peak that, we should note, was reached during the period of Mare Nostrum&rsquo;s operation. What is clear is that MN could only address this increasing danger of the crossings partially, as MN assets deployed close to the Libyan coast came to operate as a &ldquo;half-way bridge to Europe&rdquo;,<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Afri<strong>ca</strong> Europe <strong>I</strong>nteract<strong> (AEI)</strong>, &ldquo;Mare Nostrum: Resistance from below forces Europe to save people&rdquo;, 4 August 2014<strong>,</strong> <a href="http://afrique-europe-interact.net/1205-1-Mare-Nostrum">http://afrique-europe-interact.net/1205-1-Mare-Nostrum</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> still forcing migrants to resort to the service of smugglers for the first stretch of their journey.</p>


				<p>Furthermore, we believe that beyond the practices of smugglers, other factors contributing to migrants&rsquo; deaths at sea were at work. Firstly, while providing detailed reconstructions of the cases of deaths that occurred during 2014 is beyond the scope of this report, a cursory glance reveals that several of the largest cases of deaths at sea of summer 2014 amounted to simple murder, and that this murderous behaviour cannot be attributed to the effects of MN.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See in particular the 22<sup>nd</sup> of July 2014 case, in which following the rescue of 569 people from a boat that initially carried some 750 people, thirty corpses were found under the deck and survivors described how about 110 people had been stabbed and/or thrown over board by the smugglers while they were trying to get out from under the deck. &ldquo;Five arrested for murder of over 100 migrants at sea&rdquo;, <em>Malta Today</em>, 24 July 2014, <a href='http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/world/41550/five_arrested_for_murder_of_over_100_migrants_at_sea'>http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/world/41550/five_arrested_for_murder_of_over_100_migrants_at_sea</a>, (last accessed 12 April 2016). Similarly, for the 6th September 2014, a boat carrying some 550 passengers that had left Egypt was sunk by the smugglers organizing the travel after the passengers refused to change boats in the open sea. Only 9 people survived. Peter Walker and John Hooper, &ldquo;100 children among migrants 'deliberately drowned' in Mediterranean&rdquo;, <em>The Guardian</em>, 16 September 2014, <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/16/migrants-children-drowned-boat-mediterranean'>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/16/migrants-children-drowned-boat-mediterranean</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Secondly, the spike in deaths at sea and mortality during the summer of 2014 (June&ndash;September) coincided with the worsening political context in Libya (see Porsia in annex), which certainly contributed to increased crossings<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See statistical <a href=#>annex</a>.

MN assets themselves were overwhelmed by the novel scale of crossings and the shift in their modus operandi, which is indicated by the increasing recourse to commercial vessels to commercial vessels over this same period.</p>

		          What emerges from the above is that MN began operating in the midst of a growing storm, in which the combined exodus of Syrians (and of other nationalities), together with growing instability in transit countries such as Egypt and Libya, and the resulting changing practices of smugglers were leading to record numbers of crossings in increasingly dangerous conditions.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34"><strong>[34]</strong></a><sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-toggle="popover" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="This multiplicity of factors was acknowledged by Frontex itself, which in its 28 August 2014 &ldquo;concept document&rdquo; for Triton which we will analyse in more detail later. Before repeating the argument of MN as a &ldquo;pull-factor&rdquo;, Frontex&rsquo;assessment underlines the presence of multiple factors determining migration patters at the time (including the volatile situation of Syrians in their home country and elsewhere and the high level of insecurity in Libya). Frontex, <em>Concept of reinforced joint operation tackling the migratory flows towards Italy: JO EPN-Triton</em>, 28 August 2014, p. 6 (see full document in annex). Initially made available at <a href='http://www.avvenire.it/Cronaca/Documents/JOU%20Concept%20on%20EPN'>http://www.avvenire.it/Cronaca/Documents/JOU%20Concept%20on%20EPN</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> Despite the vast resources put in place, MN did not manage to curb the increasing mortality rate at sea. However, it is also clear that MN was not the main cause of this increase. 
		          </p>
		        </div>


				<p>Considering the trends of late 2013, it is probable that without MN in place, a similar number of arrivals would have been reached, and both the number of deaths and mortality would have continued to soar, as the twin October 2013 shipwrecks indicate. The peak in the mortality rate observed in summer 2014 further suggests, it was not less of MN that was needed to bring the number of deaths and the danger of crossings down, but <em>more</em> of it.</p>

		          The ending of MN was thus justified on the argument that MN was the cause of more arrivals and more deaths. However, if, as we have demonstrated, increased crossings and deaths were related to deeper regional factors, discontinuing Mare Nostrum would not lead to less crossings but to more deaths at sea. This forecast was available to EU policy makers and agencies, and yet, as the following sections will show, they decided to end MN and (not)replace it with a more limited Frontex operation in all knowledge of the deadly consequences this policy would have.
