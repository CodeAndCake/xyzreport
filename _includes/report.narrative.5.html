        </div>

        <p>The week starting on 12 April 2015 saw two successive shipwrecks, which together cost the lives of more than 1,200 people. The tragedy that had been announced by the shipwrecks of early 2015 and predicted by the human rights community, the shipping industry and MEPs, had taken place.</p>

        <p>The month of April usually sees a strong increase in the number of crossings, with migrants taking advantage of improving meteorological conditions after the winter months. 2015 was no exception: the arrivals in Italy went from 2,283 in March to 16,063 by the end of April according to UNHCR data. More than 8,000 people were rescued in the four days from 10 to 13 April 2015 alone. The 12 April represented a peak, with 3,791 people rescued that day.

        Given the scale of the events, it is not surprising that the limited SAR capacities left after the start of Triton proved inadequate, leading to the 12 April shipwreck.</p>

        <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">The reconstruction of this case is based on the following sources: interviews conducted by Forensic Oceanography with two groups of survivors in a reception centre in Italy &ndash; the first composed of fourteen English speakers (abbreviated as ENG), and the second of seven French speakers (FR);

        {% include footnote-block.html content='Both interviews were conducted on 4 May 2015 in Marco (Trento, Italy). In the following we refer to the line numbers of the interview transcripts, which may be made available upon request.' %}

        AIS vessel tracking data analysis; photographs taken during the events by one of the intervening ships; and SAR reports.</p>

        <p>The migrants&rsquo; vessel departed from the port of Zuwara in the night of 11/12 April 2015. Before the departure, some had been waiting in a safe house in Tripoli for a week (FR 18). As of midnight, the migrants were taken in small rubber boats towards a bigger wooden fishing boat with three decks (FR 8, 43). There were between 600 and 700 people on board (FR 56). The boat left Zuwara around 03:00 GMT on 12 April. </p>

        <p>However, shortly after having departed, the boat started encountering difficulties. Engine problems appeared to have taken one to two hours to repair (ENG 43), and the bilge pump stopped functioning and vessel began to take on water. One survivor recalled: &ldquo;Inside the boat, they say there is a pump that takes the water out, but when this problem occurred the pump stopped so the boat was taking a lot of water, and people were just taking the water out manually, using clothes and bottles&rdquo; (ENG 43&ndash;46).</p>

        <p>According to survivors who were located on the upper deck of the boat near the captain, at around 12:00 GMT a distress call was placed. One of the survivors recalled the interaction as follows:</p>

        <div class="quote">
          <div class="quote-text">
            &ldquo;He called the Red Cross, he was told that he hadn&rsquo;t arrived yet, he should continue. We continued until 13:00 and we called them again, he was told that he should continue, that he only had 110 km left before being taken. Then he called again, and he was told that there were only 20 km left. Then, as we were moving, we saw boats&rdquo; (FR 64&ndash;68).

        </div>

        <p>As the Italian Coast Guard has not provided us with the full SAR report concerning this event, we do not know if they took any specific action at this stage when the distress call was made. It appears that since the migrants&rsquo; vessel was located close to the Libyan coast and was still able to advance with a functioning engine, the Coast Guard indicated to the driver to continue navigating in the direction of Lampedusa so as to come closer to SAR vessels &ndash; of which very few are accounted for by the AIS data (see for example vessel CP 324 departing Lampedusa after the boat has capsized).</p>

        <p>However, as migrant vessel continued northward, some time after 13:00 GMT, they saw other vessels in the distance and began to discern an oil platform surrounded by ships (FR 70&ndash;77; ENG 188). This is collaborated by the AIS data, which shows the platform ENSCO 5004 in operation at the Bouri oil fields less than 1 km from the location of the migrant vessel capsizing. As the boat approached the nearby ships, doubts emerged between the migrants on board as to whether these would be Libyan or of other nationalities. The boat advanced slowly, stopping and starting again, to the rhythm of the arguments of the passengers. As they approached the unknown vessels near the oil rig many migrants moved to see the unknown vessels and the now unstable migrant vessel began to roll to the port side (left). Some migrants attempted to return their vessel to a point of equilibrium, but the unstable, overloaded migrant vessel continued to roll over and capsized (FR 80&ndash;90). The position later provided in a distress signal by the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Rome as the location of the event was <strong>34-05.0N 012-24.8E</strong>. AIS data shows the tracks of the vessels present at the time and location of the event.</p>

        <p>Comparing surviving migrant testimony and the AIS data allows us to corroborate the identity of the vessels involved. The survivors recalled the colour of the first ship they encountered as &ldquo;blue&rdquo; (FR 95; ENG 134), and of a shape characteristic of oil platform supply vessels. The presence of the writing, &ldquo;St. John&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rescue zone&rdquo; on the side of the first ship was confirmed by all testimonies. The <em>OOC Jaguar</em> tug, accounted for by AIS data, is indeed a blue supply vessel and bears the writing &ldquo;St. John&rsquo;s&rdquo; on its hull, below its name. This first vessel would then be followed by two other vessels that the survivors remembered as &ldquo;red&rdquo; (FR 137; ENG 188); the <em>Asso Ventuno</em> and <em>Asso Ventiquattro</em>, the presence of both of which has been documented by AIS data, have a red hull. Moreover, the <em>Asso Ventiquattro</em> bears the writing &ldquo;Rescue Zone&rdquo; and, when shown the pictures of the <em>Asso Ventuno</em>, all migrants recognized this as the ship that assisted in the rescue operations.</p>

        <p>Photographs released to the press in the immediate aftermath of the shipwreck by Opielok Offshore Carriers GmbH, the company managing the <em>OOC Jaguar</em>, provide further evidence of the unfolding of events. The first photograph shows the migrants&rsquo; boat clearly tipping to the left side in the distance, and this despite a calm sea (see the oceanographic analysis in annex). By extracting the metadata from the digital photograph&rsquo;s file, we can determine that this photograph was taken with a small compact camera at 17:11:44. While the metadata does not specify the time zone, we assess this to be Central European Time, which at the time was GMT+2. Thus, the photograph was taken at 15:11:44 GMT. The focal length used is 15.40 mm or 87 mm in 35 mm equivalent focal length, what is normally considered a long-focus lens, and the angle of vision in relation to the surface of the water is low as the horizon remains visible. This indicates that the photograph was taken when the <em>OOC Jaguar</em> was still relatively far from the migrants&rsquo; boat. This is corroborated by the vessel&rsquo;s location according to the AIS track at the time the photograph was taken.</p>

        <p>The next photograph provided by Opielok Offshore Carriers GmbH shows the boat already having capsized and with the passengers in the water, some of them still clinging to the overturned boat, others adrift. The photograph&rsquo;s metadata indicates this image was taken at 15:54:49 GMT. This time the focal length is 10.70 mm or 60 mm in 35 mm equivalent focal length, close to what is considered a normal lens, and the angle of vision is higher in relation to the surface of the water (no horizon is visible), indicating that the photograph was taken when the boat was very close to the migrants. Once again, this is corroborated by the position at which the vessel was located according to the AIS track at the time the photograph was taken.</p>

        <p>The sequence of events that occurred in the time <em>between</em> the two released photographs &ndash; the 43 minutes that ultimately saw the boat capsize &ndash; is as of yet not entirely clarified. Important elements that would be necessary for a complete reconstruction are missing. In particular, MRCC Rome has refused us access to the detailed SAR report for this event, while, despite a productive dialogue, Opielok Offshore Carriers GmbH has not yet shared with us the elements of evidence they possess (such as the ship&rsquo;s log book, VHF voice recordings and the testimony of the captain). What we offer here is thus a tentative reconstruction based mainly on survivor testimonies that may be amended should we receive further information from the other actors directly involved.</p>

        <p>One of the survivors located near the migrant vessel captain recalls how their boat approached the <em>OOC Jaguar</em> as follows:</p>

        <div class="quote">
          <div class="quote-text">
            &ldquo;They were not coming towards us, so now we had to start our engine again, to move towards them [&hellip;], but at that time, the boat was tilting to one side and then tilting to the other side again, and we moved until we were very closed to them now. Then everyone, those from the lower deck, started to come outside, and those from the top were starting to come down, because everyone was hassling to be rescued first, so it was like a push and pull. People were shouting at each other, &lsquo;go down go to your place!&rsquo;, but no one was listening to one another, and then when the boat tilted to this side, and then everyone shouted, &lsquo;return to your place&rsquo;, and when they came back to the other side, then the boat sank&rdquo; (ENG 95-105).

        </div>

        <p>The francophone survivors described a similar sequence of events, but did not specify their timing (FR 81&ndash;91). It appears that as the migrants moved closer to port side of their vessel to be rescued, they became agitated and the agitation grew out of control. It is precisely to avoid such situations that professional rescuers often keep their vessel at a distance from a boat in distress and deploy one or two Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIB) towards it. This allows personnel on board the RHIB to assess the situation and maintain order on board the boat.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='Such procedures have been described to us by the Italian Coast Guard and are illustrated by countless cases of rescue at sea. Amnesty international summarized them well in their report: &ldquo;The Italian and Maltese coastguards both told Amnesty International that preventing the capsizing of the boat being rescued is a primary concern. They know that people on a boat in distress tend to stand up suddenly when they see rescuers approaching and move to the side from where they see help coming. To avoid such risk, professional rescuers approach the boat with a smaller vessel such as a rigid-inflatable boat (rib), on the front, or with two ribs, one on either side.&rdquo; Amnesty International, <em>Europe&rsquo;s Sinking Shame</em>, p. 12.' %}

        The trained personnel necessary to implement this particular knowhow so as to manage the extremely difficult and dangerous rescue of an overcrowded and unseaworthy boat, however, were not available to the <em>OOC Jaguar</em>.</p>

        <p>While the exact moment of capsizing in not known to us, the behaviour of the <em>OOC Jaguar</em> would seem to indicate that it occurred shortly after 15:30 GMT. The AIS track of the ship, which until that moment had been advancing at minimal speed, shows in fact at 15:36 GMT a manoeuver to approach the position of the boat when it capsized, with the <em>OOC Jaguar</em> accelerating considerably. A few minutes later, at 15:48 GMT, the vessel slows down again and takes a sharp turn (or moves back in reverse). This might be a manoeuvre to back off from the location of boat just after it capsized. Finally, at 15:51 GMT, it moves forward again the capsized location. It is at this time that the second and third photographs were taken showing the capsized boat.</p>

        <p>Several of the survivors interviewed by Forensic Oceanography have claimed that a relatively long time (15 to 30 minutes, ENG 263) passed before the crew of the <em>OOC Jaguar</em> began to carry out a rescue operation by deploying its RHIB. During this time, the survivors claim, the crew of the <em>OOC</em> had been taking pictures but not providing them with assistance.</p>

        <p>Since evidence from MRCC Rome and Opielok Offshore Carriers GmbH has not been released to us, it is not possible to corroborate or disprove this account, or to explain the actions the crew was undertaking during this time to deploy its rescue boats (such as communicating with MRCC Rome, preparing the crew to respond and preparing the life rafts). However, a third photograph was taken at <strong>15:54:53 GMT</strong>, seconds after the previous one showing migrants clinging onto the capsized boat, but showing a different perspective (the horizon is visible again). This time, the photograph shows a small rescue boat approaching the drifting migrants.</p>

        <p>A fourth photograph taken at <strong>16:45:51 GMT</strong> shows the small rescue boat aside the <em>OOC Jaguar</em> with survivors on board. Without knowing with certainty the exact time at which the boat capsized, we cannot estimate the time that was necessary for the crew of the <em>OOC Jaguar</em> to deploy its rescue boat.</p>

        <p>Between 16:35 and 16:43 GMT, two other tugboats, the <em>Asso Ventuno</em> and <em>Asso Ventiquattro</em>, arrived on scene and started to carry out rescue operations, as their AIS tracks indicate. Immediately before that, at <strong>16:37 GMT</strong>, MRCC Rome had sent out a distress signal to all vessels in the vicinity requesting assistance for the capsized passengers and indicating the following position: <strong>34-05.0N 012-24.8E.</strong></p>

        <p>( 121637Z APR 2015 )</p>

        <p>According to the Frontex SAR report, further assets were deployed to assist with the rescue operations: the Italian Coast Guard fixed wing aircraft &ldquo;Manta 10-03&rdquo;, the CP 324 vessel (financed by Frontex), the CP 287 and the Italian Navy ship <em>Bersagliere</em>, which is also depicted as present on the scene in another photo taken from the <em>OOC Jaguar</em>.</p>

        <p>What is clear, however, is that the only available rescue vessels were not sufficient to respond to the numerous people adrift at sea and desperately trying to stay afloat without life jackets. As already recalled, at the same time many other vessels were providing assistance to various migrants&rsquo; boats in distress at other locations.</p>

        <p>All 145 rescued migrants and 1 dead body were transhipped onto the Navy vessel, while 8 other bodies were transhipped onto the CP287. Considering that there were at least 600 people on board the boat (FR 56), the death toll surely surpasses the 400 mark.</p>

        {% include bold-block.html content='While questions remain open concerning the precise unfolding of the events that ultimately led to this capsizing accident, it appears that the crew of the OOC Jaguar did everything it could to rescue the passengers in distress both before and after the boat capsized.

        <p>The worst predictions of the human rights community were thus taking shape. However, these events were still not enough to spur EU member states and agencies into taking urgent action. One week later, an even greater toll in human lives would be taken in another case of &ldquo;death by rescue&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>On 18 April 2015, a boat carrying more than 800 people capsized after ramming into the <em>King Jacob</em>, a large commercial vessel that was approaching it to carry out a rescue operation. Only 28 people could be rescued and 24 bodies were retrieved. It is thus believed that close to 800 people died in this incident.</p>

        <p>The reconstruction of this case is based on interviews we conducted in Catania in October 2015 with two French-speaking survivors, S. from Ivory Coast and O. from Senegal (abbreviated as SO), and with an English-speaking survivor, S. from Sierra Leone (abbreviated as S).

        {% include footnote-block.html content='In the following we refer to the line numbers of the interview transcripts, which may be made available upon request.' %}

        We then corroborated their testimonies with further elements of evidence. We first relied on materials produced in the frame of the legal proceedings launched by the Tribunal of Catania against those accused of being the smugglers driving the boat (&ldquo;Ordinanza Mohammed Ali Malek&rdquo;, abbreviated as OMAM, and documents provided by the defense lawyer, Avv. Ferrante, abbreviated as AF). We also used Automated Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data and a Hydrolant distress signal. We should note here that neither the Italian Coast Guard nor OSM Shipping GmbH &amp; Co. KG, the company that managed the <em>King Jacob</em>, have shared any evidence directly with us. This lack of transparency, however, has not prevented us from achieving a coherent understanding of the unfolding of events. The following chain of events emerges from the combination of these different sources.</p>

        {% include vimeo-block.html videoID='163057234' caption='Interview with the survivors of the 18 April shipwreck. Credit: Forensic Oceanography. Editing: Laure Vermeersch. Research assistant: Sabine Llewellyn' %}

        <p>The two survivors from Senegal and Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire recounted to us that, prior to embarking, they had been held captive in a detention centre in Tripoli, from where, at around 19:00 GMT on 17 April 2015, they and more than one hundred fellow captives were brought by the guards directly to the beach in trucks (SO 16&ndash;28). They remembered the beach as that of &ldquo;Garapoli&rdquo;, probably corresponding to the town of Garabulli (SO 67) in the East of Tripoli. When they arrived on the beach, they saw many other people already waiting in lines, under the orders of 11 to12 armed smugglers. Around midnight, they began bringing the migrants in small zodiac boats containing around 100 people at a time to the larger fishing vessel anchored off the coast, a process that lasted until 03:00&ndash;04:00 GMT on the morning of 18 April 2015 (SO 124&ndash;34). Based on the number of journeys needed to fill the boat, the survivors estimated that there were more than 800 people in total on board (SO 99&ndash;109). As they boarded the large fishing boat, they were dispatched to different sections, with two of the interviewees being seated in the top cabin, close to the driver (S 195; SO 198&ndash;203). As they boarded the wooden fishing vessel, O. remembered thinking: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over. Deaths awaits us. [&hellip;] I did not believe that we would survive. Because so many people like this, on a boat, we were not well organised. [&hellip;] It seemed like they wanted to kill us even, because they threw us to the sea&rdquo; (SO 256&ndash;60).</p>

        <p>No photograph of the fishing vessel has been accessed to date, and it is probable that none exists just prior to the capsizing since the incident occurred during the night. However, an underwater expedition directed by the Italian Navy was able to locate the wreck, provide a sonar estimation of its dimensions (length: 21 m; width: 8 m; height of the hull above the seabed: 8 m), identify signs of collision compatible with the reconstruction provided by the captain of the <em>King Jacob</em> (an impact on the boat&rsquo;s bow, damage on its left side and the balustrade collapsed) and ascertain the presence of several bodies inside the boat. While the complete documentation was not released to us, the images released publicly by the Italian Navy show the hull of the boat in resting on the sea floor.</p>

        {% include vimeo-block.html videoID='163139486' caption='Underwater video of the 18 April 2015 shipwreck. Credit: Italian Navy.' %}

        <p>Around 04:00 GMT on 18 April, the migrants&rsquo; boat started navigating. It advanced slowly throughout the day, with the boat appearing unstable from the start (SO 262). Around 17:00 GMT on the same day, SO recall the driver placing a call with a phone to request assistance (SO 293). Based on reports to the prosecutor of Catania, as well as further evidence, this event and its timing was confirmed by Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Rome in the context of the already mentioned legal proceedings: at <strong>17:35 GMT</strong> a distress call was received by MRCC Rome from a boat located within the (non-declared) Libyan SAR zone. At 18:43 GMT, MRCC Rome was able to locate the exact position at the moment of the distress call at coordinates: <strong>Lat. 33&deg;51&rsquo;50&rsquo;&rsquo; N &ndash; Long. 014&deg;26&rsquo;13&rsquo;&rsquo; E</strong> (AF).</p>

MRCC Rome also dispatched the Italian Coast Guard vessel <em>Gregoretti</em> (CP 920) to the location of the call (OMAM 2), which is accounted for in the AIS data as navigating towards the location of distress as of at least 19:30 GMT (no data is available for before this). Moreover, AIS data also shows the vehicle carrier <em>City of Lutece</em> also navigating to the distress location, although from the information currently in our possession it is unclear when it was actually contacted by the MRCC in Rome.</p>

        <p>According to the survivors we met, after contacting MRCC Rome, the migrants&rsquo; boat remained adrift with the engines shut down for some time, until around 19:00 GMT, when the survivors recall a helicopter that hovered over their boat and left (SO 304). After this, they resumed navigation.</p>

        <p>Around 21:00 GMT, according to the captain of the <em>King Jacob</em>, while the migrants&rsquo; boat was not observed directly in the dark, the cargo ship&rsquo;s radar indicated the presence of a small vessel 6 nm away, towards which the Portuguese ship continued to navigate (OMAM 18). The migrants&rsquo; boat was proceeding without lights (OMAM 14&ndash;15). This timing corresponds to that remembered by the survivors who describe seeing a large vessel in the distance at around 21:00 GMT. The driver lit a small torch to attract the vessel&rsquo;s attention (SO 323&ndash;28). This probably corresponds to the moment at which, according to the testimony of the captain of the <em>King Jacob</em>, a small light coming from the migrants&rsquo; boat was first sighted at a distance of three nm. At that point, the captain of the <em>King Jacob</em> gave orders to switch on the right spotlight of the ship, which was not able, however, to shed light on the boat. The left spotlight was then also switched on, while the ship continued approaching the small light coming from the boat (OMAM 18). At <strong>21:11</strong> GMT, at the moment of this first sighting, the <em>King Jacob</em> provided to the Italian Coast Guard vessel Gregoretti the following position for the migrants&rsquo; boat: <strong>Lat. 33&deg;56&rsquo; N &ndash; Long. 014&deg;28&rsquo; E</strong> (AF).</p>

        <p>Between 21:11 and 21:20 GMT<em>, </em>at about 1 nm from the migrants&rsquo; boat, the captain of the <em>King Jacob</em> realized that the boat was terribly overloaded and therefore changed course four times in order to avoid collision (for a total duration of about 8 minutes) since the migrants&rsquo; boat continued to follow the <em>King Jacob</em> with a course that would inevitably lead to collision. After this, the <em>King Jacob</em> switched off its engines at the following coordinates: <strong>Lat</strong>. <strong>33&deg;51'.9N - Long. 14&deg;26'.2E</strong>. (OMAM 18). The AIS data does not allow to show each one of these maneuvers, but the <em>King Jacob</em> vessel&rsquo;s track is compatible with the overall description of events. At 21:20 GMT, the captain of the <em>King Jacob</em> ordered all the crew to go onto the main deck to assist in the embarkation of the migrants. According to his testimony, the ships&rsquo; spotlights continued to illuminate the migrants&rsquo; boat. While the latter initially moved slowly towards the cargo ship, all of a sudden, at a distance of about 100 m, the migrants&rsquo; boat accelerated and changed course, moving towards the cargo ship&rsquo;s left side and eventually crashing its bow against it. After the collision, came up alongside the <em>King Jacob</em>, rubbing against its side in a backwards motion. According to the captain of the <em>King Jacob</em>, at the time of the collision the engines were turned off and the ship was not moving, so the backward movement of the migrants&rsquo; boat was due to the latter boat reversing. Lawyer Ferrante disagreed with this reconstruction, claiming that his client (the driver of the migrants&rsquo; boat) did not activate the engines and that it was indeed the <em>King Jacob </em>that was moving headway without propulsion. While the exact dynamic of the impact is still being ascertained, what is certain is that the migrants&rsquo; boat then capsized on its right side and sank within 5 minutes (OMAM 18).</p>

        <p>The survivors interviewed for this report recalled the incident in a similar way; however, they recalled that the spotlight was turned on just as the boat began advancing, spurring the reaction of the captain<em> (</em>SO 378&ndash;93, see also S 246&ndash;49). One of the survivors drew a sketch of the collision, describing it in these terms:</p>

        <div class="quote">
          <div class="quote-text">
            &ldquo;The other boat stopped. It stopped 5 minutes something like that. We continued advancing slowly. The other boat put its spotlight on us. At that movement, our diver accelerated, he accelerated until here, and hit the boat in the middle and slid all the way to here, and sunk&rdquo; (SO 426&ndash;33).

        <p>While some of the survivors&rsquo; testimonies collected by the Public Prosecutor's office&nbsp;in Catania do not mention a variation of speed in the moments immediately preceding the impact (OMAM 14&ndash;15), it was recalled by survivor K., who attributed the wrong manoeuvres that led to the collision to the fact that the captain had been trying to &ldquo;escape&rdquo; once he realized that the cargo ship&rsquo;s crew was not Italian. Furthermore, another survivor claimed that as the migrants&rsquo; boat was approaching, all of a sudden it accelerated as if it wanted to escape (source of both testimonies: OMAM 14&ndash;15). In addition, all survivors heard by the Procura agree that there were three collisions between the two ships (OMAM 14&ndash;16). Traces of the collision were reported on the side of the <em>King Jacob</em> upon its inspection in port.</p>

        <p>S., the survivor from Sierra Leone interviewed by Forensic Oceanography, was thrown from the migrants&rsquo; boat by the collision, and landed on the deck of the cargo ship. From there, he could observe the tragic scene unfolding before his eyes:</p>

        <p>Shortly after the collision, the <em>King Jacob</em> carried out a so-called Williamson turn to go back to the place of the shipwreck and search for people in the water (AF), which we can see indicated in the loop formed by the AIS data track within the 20 minutes following the moment of collision. At 21:28 GMT, the <em>King Jacob</em> communicated to Italian Coast Guard vessel <em>Gregoretti</em> that there had been a collision with the migrants&rsquo; boat during the approach phase (AF). The position of the collision was determined by the <em>Gregoretti</em> with its onboard instruments as Lat. 33&deg;57.5&rsquo; N &ndash; Long. 014&deg;28.3&rsquo; E (AF). At 21:32 GMT, the intervention of a helicopter was requested to search for the shipwrecked (OMAM 2). At 21:42 GMT, the <em>Gregoretti</em>, which in the meantime was appointed &ldquo;On Scene Commander&rdquo;, communicated that it had rescued 10 people (OMAM 2). By 22:25 GMT<em>, </em>28 people had been rescued (one of them was evacuated by helicopter to the Cannizzaro hospital in Catania) and 24 bodies retrieved. The bodies were taken by the <em>Gregoretti</em> ship to Malta, while the survivors were taken to Catania (OMAM 2).</p>

        <p>Despite the rescue efforts, the death toll in this shipwreck was simply cataclysmic. As with the 12 April shipwreck, it appears that no direct responsibility for these tragic events can be attributed to the <em>King Jacob</em> and its crew. This was also the conclusion reached by the public prosecutor in Catania. The <em>King Jacob</em> is a 147 m long container ship of, i.e. approximately seven times longer than the migrants&rsquo; boat it was tasked to rescue. Its sides are very high and utterly unfit for boarding a boat of that size and transferring its passengers. The crew of such a ship normally counts no more than 20 people, who usually lack specific training for rescue operations of this kind. Moreover, despite the calm sea (see oceanographic analysis in annex), the darkness certainly did not help to facilitate the rescue operation. What appears certain is that, considering the horrendous conditions in which the migrants were being sent out to the sea, only the highest level of professionalism and the most adapted means could hope to lead to safe rescue operations.</p>

        <p>In the week between 12 and 18 April 2015, more than 1200 people had been swallowed by the currents as a result of their boats capsizing just as they were about to be rescued. Beyond the huge death toll, what is most striking about these events is that they were not the result of the reluctance to carry out rescue operations, which has been identified as a structural cause of migrants&rsquo; deaths in the Mediterranean Sea.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='See &ldquo;Background&rdquo; section of this report and Forensic Oceanography&rsquo;s previous investigation on the Left-to-die boat case available at <a href="http://www.forensic-architecture.org/case/left-die-boat/">http://www.forensic-architecture.org/case/left-die-boat/</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016)' %} 

        In these two cases, the actual loss of life has occurred <em>during</em> and partly <em>through</em> the rescue operation itself.</p>

        {% include bold-block.html content='While it could appear that only the ruthless smugglers who overcrowded unseaworthy boats to the point of collapse are to blame, in light of the sequence of events and policy decisions we have reconstructed in our report, we can see another level of political responsibility that created the conditions in which these tragedies were bound to occur. The EU&rsquo;s policy of retreat of state-operated rescue at sea left ill-adapted commercial vessels to bear most of the responsibility for rescuing and this, in turn, led to <em>assistance becoming deadly.</em> Death by rescue was thus the outcome of the EU&rsquo;s policies of non-assistance.' %}

        <p>The disastrous effects of this phenomenon are tragically confirmed by the data on arrivals, crossing and deaths at sea for the first four months of 2015: while in the first four months of 2014, more than 26,000 had crossed and 60 deaths had been recorded, in the same period of 2015 an almost identical number of crossings had occurred, but the number deaths had increased to 1,687. The probability of dying at sea was had thus increased 30 fold, jumping from 2 deaths in 1000 crossings to 60 in 1000 (see statistical annex).</p>

        <p>The 18 April 2015 tragedy led to a public outcry and numerous scandalised statements. The UNHCR titled its 19 April 2015 press release &ldquo;New Mediterranean boat tragedy may be biggest ever&rdquo;, and called for urgent action by the EU.

        {% include footnote-block.html content='UNHCR, &ldquo;New Mediterranean boat tragedy may be biggest ever&rdquo;, 19 April 2015 <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/5533c2406.html">http://www.unhcr.org/5533c2406.html</a> (last accessed 12 April 2016).' %}

        <p>Despite the statements expressing their deep concern for the dead, little consideration was given to the survivors. Despite their trauma, nineteen out of the 28 survivors were brought to the infamous centre for asylum seekers (CARA) in Mineo, one of the biggest in Europe. Among them were the survivors we interviewed. The Territorial Commission, responsible for examining asylum requests in Italy, recommended the Police headquarter to grant them with a resident permit on humanitarian grounds, which would have allowed them to leave Mineo. Furthermore, on the 22 April, Domenico Lucano, Mayor of Riace, offered to host them in his town, which has become in recent years an example of hospitality for refugees. However, nobody informed the survivors of these possibilities until six months later, they met a representative of the Catania Antiracist League, on the occasion of our interview. The survivors of the 18 April tragedy were confronted&nbsp;with the same indifference and precarity faced by thousands of others migrants&nbsp;who have arrived in Italy in the recent years.</p>
