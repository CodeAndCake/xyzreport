Three bodies of international law are applicable to the situation in Gaza and Israel during the period covered in this report: international humanitarian law (including the law of occupation), international human rights law and international criminal law.
</p>
<p>
International humanitarian law is a body of rules and principles whose central purpose is to limit, as much as possible, human suffering in times of armed conflict. It sets out standards of humane conduct and limits the means and methods of conducting military operations. Its focus is the protection of those not participating in hostilities, particularly civilians, as well as combatants who are sick, wounded or captured. 
</p>
<p>
States are also bound by their obligations under international human rights law, which applies during armed conflict and in peacetime. It includes treaties guaranteeing civil and political rights, and economic, social, and cultural rights. A fundamental principle of international human rights law is that victims of serious human rights violations have the right to remedies, including justice, truth and reparations.
</p>
<p>
International criminal law establishes individual criminal responsibility for certain violations and abuses of international human rights and international humanitarian law, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, as well as torture, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearance. 
</p>

INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW
</span></h2></div>
<p>
The rules on the conduct of hostilities, which are most relevant to this report, are set out in the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I, adopted in 1977). Israel is a party to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, but not to Protocol I or Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II, also adopted in 1977). Nonetheless, the rules cited below reflect customary international humanitarian law and are legally binding on all parties to an armed conflict “as general practice accepted as law.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>
<p>
Israel is also bound by relevant rules of occupation law, including provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention and of the Hague Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its annexed Regulations of 1907.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See Amnesty International, “Why does Amnesty International still consider Israel the occupying power in the Gaza Strip, and what are Israel’s obligations as the occupying power?” in <i>Questions & Answers: Israel/Gaza conflict, July 2014</i>, 25 July 2014, <a href='https://www.amnesty.org.uk/sites/default/files/gaza_qa_july_2014.pdf' target='_blank'>https://www.amnesty.org.uk/sites/default/files/gaza_qa_july_2014.pdf</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015). Article 42 of the Hague Regulations defines occupation: “Territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army. The occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised.” In interpreting this definition with respect to particular situations, the notion of “effective control” over the territory in question is central. Legal scholars continue to debate the meaning of “effective control”. It generally – but not necessarily always – entails the permanent presence of the occupying power’s military forces inside the territory. However, in cases where the occupying power has withdrawn its forces from all or parts of the occupied territory, but has maintained key elements of an occupying power’s authority, this retention of authority can amount to effective control. In such cases occupation law, or at least the provisions relevant to the powers it continues to exercise, could continue to apply. (See T Ferraro, “Determining the beginning and end of an occupation under international humanitarian law”, International Review of the Red Cross, Volume 94, Number 885, Spring 2012, pp. 157-158.)" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  
</p>
<p>
The State of Palestine has acceded to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, Protocols I and II and the Hague Convention (IV) and its annexed Regulations.
</p>

<div class="box"><h3><span class="h2-heading">
PROHIBITION ON DIRECT ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS AND CIVILIAN OBJECTS – THE PRINCIPLE OF DISTINCTION
</span></h3></div>
<p>
A fundamental rule of international humanitarian law is that parties to an armed conflict must at all times “distinguish between civilians and combatants”, especially in that “attacks may only be directed against combatants” and “must not be directed against civilians.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 1; see also Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I), Article 48, and Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol II), Article 12(2)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  A similar rule requires parties to distinguish between “civilian objects” and “military objectives”. These rules are part of the fundamental principle of “distinction”.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="In the context of the conflict in Gaza and Israel and in this report, Amnesty International uses the term “civilian” to describe people who were not taking direct part in the hostilities. In case of doubt, individuals should be presumed to be civilians." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
“Civilian objects are all objects that are not military objectives.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 9." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  And military objectives are “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralisation, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 8." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  Military advantage may not be interpreted so broadly as to render the rule ineffective. Using this provision to justify attacks aimed at harming the economy of a state or demoralizing the civilian population in order to weaken the ability to fight would distort the legal meaning of military advantage, undermine fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, and pose a severe threat to civilians.
</p>
<p>
Objects (or locations) that do not meet these criteria are civilian objects. In cases where it is unclear whether a specific object such as a home or residential building, place of worship, school, media office, medical facility, or government building is being used for military purposes, “it shall be presumed not to be so used”.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Protocol I, Article 52(3). The authoritative ICRC Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions interprets the expression “definite military advantage anticipated” by stating that “it is not legitimate to launch an attack which only offers potential or indeterminate advantages.”" data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
According to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking direct part in hostilities and intentionally directing attacks against civilian objects constitute war crimes.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Article 8(2)(b)(i) and(ii)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
In addition, as regards the destruction of entire homes, orchards, and businesses the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention regulates Israel’s actions as the occupying power in the Gaza Strip. Article 53 provides that:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.” 
</div>
</div>
<p>
According to Article 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, “extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly” is a grave breach of the Convention, and thus a war crime. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to benefiting from the protection accorded civilians and civilian objects, certain persons and objects are afforded special protection under international humanitarian law. Medical personnel and medical transports must be respected and protected in all circumstances.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rules 26 and 29." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  Humanitarian relief personnel and humanitarian relief objects must be respected and protected.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rules 31 and 32." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  And “special care must be taken in military operations to avoid damage to buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, education or charitable purposes and historic monuments unless they are military objectives.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 38." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> 
</p>

<div class="box"><h3><span class="h2-heading">
PROHIBITION ON INDISCRIMINATE OR DISPROPORTIONATE ATTACKS
</span></h3></div>
<p>
The corollary of the rule of distinction is that “indiscriminate attacks are prohibited”.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 11; Protocol I, Article 51(4)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  Indiscriminate attacks are those that are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction, either because the attack is not directed at a specific military objective, or because it employs a method or means of combat that cannot be directed at a specific military objective or has effects that cannot be limited as required by international humanitarian law.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 12; Protocol I, Article 51(4)(a)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  
</p>
<p>
International humanitarian law also prohibits disproportionate attacks, which are those “which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 14; Protocol I, Articles 51(5)(b) and 57." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  Intentionally launching an indiscriminate attack resulting in death or injury to civilians, or a disproportionate attack (that is, knowing that the attack will cause excessive incidental civilian loss, injury or damage) constitutes a war crime.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 156, pp. 599-601." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>
</p>

<div class="box"><h3><span class="h2-heading">
PRECAUTIONS IN ATTACK
</span></h3></div>
<p>
The protection of the civilian population and civilian objects is further underpinned by the requirement that all parties to a conflict take precautions in attack. In the conduct of military operations, then, “constant care must be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects”; “all feasible precautions” must be taken to avoid and minimize incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 15. See also Protocol II, Article 13(1)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  The parties must choose means and methods of warfare with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 17." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  Everything feasible must be done to verify that targets are military objectives, to assess the proportionality of attacks, and to halt attacks if it becomes apparent they are wrongly directed or disproportionate.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rules 16-19." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  Where circumstances permit, parties must give effective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian population.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 20." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
Parties must choose appropriate means and methods of attack when military targets are located within residential areas. This requirement rules out the use of certain types of weapons and tactics. The use of means of combat that cannot be directed at a specific military objective – such as using imprecise explosive weapons on targets located in densely populated civilian areas – may result in indiscriminate attacks and is prohibited. The use of artillery and mortars in the vicinity of densely populated civilian neighbourhoods of Rafah and other parts of Gaza – even if intended to target military objectives – violates this prohibition. Choosing methods of attack that do not minimize the risk to civilians – for example, attacking objectives at times when many civilians are most likely to be present – also violates international humanitarian law. 
</p>

<div class="box"><h3><span class="h2-heading">
PRECAUTIONS IN DEFENCE
</span></h3></div>
<p>
Warring parties have obligations to take precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects under their control against the effects of attacks by the adversary. As with precautions in attack, these rules are particularly important when fighting is taking place in areas with large numbers of civilians.
</p>
<p>
Each party to the conflict must, to the extent feasible, avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 23; see also Protocol I, Article 58(b)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  The authoritative commentary of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on this provision explains that the use of the term “feasible” is used to illustrate “the fact that no one can be required to do the impossible. In this case it is clear that precautions should not go beyond the point where the life of the population would become difficult or even impossible.” And it notes: “Moreover, a Party to the conflict cannot be expected to arrange its armed forces and installations in such a way as to make them conspicuous to the benefit of the adversary.”
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Article 50(3) of Protocol I states that “The presence within the civilian population of individuals who do not come within the definition of civilians does not deprive the population of its civilian character.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC, <i>Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977</i>, Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, and Bruno Zimmermann, eds, 1987, para. 1922." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup> 
As indicated by the ICRC in its commentary, “In wartime conditions it is inevitable that individuals belonging to the category of combatants become intermingled with the civilian population, for example, soldiers on leave visiting their families. However, provided that these are not regular units with fairly large numbers, this does not in any way change the civilian character of a population.”
</p>
<p>
In other words, the fact that Palestinian fighters may be located within civilian areas does not in any way negate Israel’s obligations with respect to civilians, including the principle of distinction, the prohibition on indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks, and the precautions in attack detailed above. 
</p>

<div class="box"><h3><span class="h2-heading">
COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT
</span></h3></div>
<p>
Since Israel imposed its military blockade on the Gaza Strip in June 2007, heightening its policies of “closure” against the Strip, which date back to the early 1990s, Amnesty International and numerous other organizations have argued that the blockade amounts to collective punishment of Gaza’s entire population.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See, for example, Amnesty International, <i>Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: Gaza blockade - collective punishment</i> (Index, MDE 15/021/2008), 4 July 2008, <a href='https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE15/021/2008/en' target='_blank'>https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE15/021/2008/en</a>; ICRC, “Gaza closure: not another year!”, 14 June 2010, <a href='http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/update/palestine-update-140610.htm' target='_blank'>http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/update/palestine-update-140610.htm</a> (last accessed 12 July 2015)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  
</p>
<p>
The Fourth Geneva Convention specifically prohibits collective punishment. Its Article 33 provides: “No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited.” 
</p>
<p>
As explained in the authoritative commentary of the ICRC: “This paragraph then lays a prohibition on collective penalties... penalties of any kind inflicted on persons or entire groups of persons, in defiance of the most elementary principles of humanity, for acts that these persons have not committed.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC, Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, p. 225." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  
</p>
<p>
Although the Israeli authorities have eased some aspects of the blockade since mid-2010, for example by removing restrictions on certain categories of imports, many aspects of the blockade and the closure regime continue, and have impeded reconstruction efforts. The combination of restrictions continues to have a severe impact on all aspects of life in Gaza. Israeli policies towards the Gaza Strip continue to violate the prohibition on collective punishment. 
</p>
<p>
Aspects of Israel’s military operations in Rafah following the capture of Israeli soldier Lieutenant Hadar Goldin may in themselves have amounted to collective punishment of the civilian population of Gaza. 
</p>

<div class="box"><h3><span class="h2-heading">
INVESTIGATION
</span></h3></div>
<p>
Under international humanitarian law, “states must investigate war crimes allegedly committed by their nationals or armed forces, or on their territory, and, if appropriate prosecute the suspects. They must also investigate other war crimes over which they have jurisdiction and, if appropriate, prosecute the suspects.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="ICRC, Customary IHL, Rule 158." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  The duty to investigate extends beyond war crimes to other violations of international humanitarian law. This derives from the obligations of states to suppress all breaches of international humanitarian law.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Geneva Convention IV, Article 146; Protocol I, Article 86(1).

INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW

As affirmed by the International Court of Justice and the UN Human Rights Committee, human rights law remains applicable during times of armed conflict, in a position complementary to international humanitarian law.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="“[T]he Court considers that the protection offered by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights”, ICJ Advisory Opinion, 9 July 2004.

Although Israel has argued that its obligations under the international human rights treaties it has ratified are not applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, this position has been rejected by all the UN bodies monitoring adherence to these treaties and by the International Court of Justice.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See, inter alia: Concluding Observations of the Human Rights Committee: Israel, 3 September 2010, CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3, para. 5; Concluding Observations of the Committee against Torture: Israel, 23 June 2009, CAT/C/ISR/4, para. 11; Concluding Observations of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Israel, 16 December 2011, E/C.12/ISR/CO/3, para. 8; ICJ Advisory Opinion, 9 July 2004, paras 111-113." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  Specific treaty bodies have also clarified that the treaty provisions apply extraterritorially in general; for example, the UN Human Rights Committee has stated, with respect to the ICCPR, that “a State party must respect and ensure the rights laid down in the Covenant to anyone within the power or effective control of that State Party, even if not situated within the territory of the State Party.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Human Rights Committee, General Comment 31, para. 10." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

<p>
As international human rights law is applicable in times of armed conflict alongside international humanitarian law, the same conduct can constitute a breach of both international human rights law and international humanitarian law. 
Article 6(1) of the ICCPR states that “Every human being has the inherent right to life… No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.” This right is a peremptory norm of international law which cannot be suspended or otherwise derogated, including in times of war.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See article 4(2) ICCPR and, inter alia, Human Rights Committee, General Comment 29 on States of Emergency, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.11, paras 7 and 11; see also Human Rights Committee, General Comment 31 on the Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, para. 11." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  During an armed conflict, the question of whether a death occurring in hostilities is an arbitrary deprivation of life is determined by international humanitarian law, particularly the rules on the conduct of hostilities. Deliberately killing a civilian who is not directly participating in hostilities is an arbitrary deprivation of life.

Other human rights obligations relevant to Israel military operations in Rafah include the obligations to respect, protect and promote: the right to adequate food and housing (ICESCR, Article 11); the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (ICESCR, Article 12), which also includes the right to water; and the right to education (ICESCR, Article 13).<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment 15, The right to water, UN Doc. E/C.12/2002/11 (2002)." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  Actions that were aimed towards or were likely to result in the destruction or impairment of infrastructure necessary for the enjoyment of those rights, including hospitals, schools, and water infrastructure, are violations for which state parties can be held responsible.
</p>
<p>
With respect to the right to housing, Israel’s destruction of homes and residential buildings in Rafah and elsewhere in Gaza during the conflict appears to constitute unlawful forced evictions, a breach of Article 11 of the ICESCR. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights defines forced evictions as “the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection.” The Committee includes among such evictions those resulting from “international armed conflicts, internal strife and communal or ethnic violence.”<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment 7, Forced evictions, and the right to adequate housing (Sixteenth session, 1997), UN Doc.

Individuals, including civilians and military personnel, can be held criminally responsible for certain violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. International law imposes the obligation to investigate and prosecute alleged perpetrators of crimes under international law and serious violations and abuses of human rights.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="International humanitarian law contains a duty to prosecute war crimes (ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rules 157 and 158). See also the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; and Amnesty International, <i>United Kingdom: The Pinochet case - universal jurisdiction and absence of immunity for crimes against humanity</i> (Index: EUR 45/01/99), January 1999. " data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>  Israel has the obligation under international law to ensure that, where sufficient evidence exists, individuals suspected of committing crimes under international law are prosecuted in fair trials without recourse to the death penalty. Israel must also ensure that effective remedies are put in place and that victims are provided with fair and just reparation including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, adopted and proclaimed by General Assembly resolution 60/147 of 16 December 2005." data-html="true"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark"></span></a></sup>

Under the principle of universal jurisdiction, all states have an obligation to investigate and, where enough admissible evidence is gathered, prosecute crimes under international law, including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances.<sup><a data-placement="top" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" role="button" data-content="See for example ICJ, <i>Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)</i>, Judgment, ICJ Reports 2002, p. 3, where the majority of the court confirmed the right of all states to exercise universal jurisdiction.

According to Article 7 of the Rome Statute, certain acts, if directed against a civilian population as part of a widespread or systematic attack, and as part of a state or organizational policy, amount to crimes against humanity. Such acts include, among others, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer of population, imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law, torture, rape and other sexual crimes, and enforced disappearances. Crimes against humanity can be committed either during a time of peace or during an armed conflict.

Military commanders and civilian superiors can be held responsible for the acts of their subordinates. Article 86(2) of Protocol I, which imposes a single standard for military commanders and civilian superiors, reflects customary international law. It states:
</p>
<div class="quote">
<div class="quote-text">
    “The fact that a breach of the [1949 Geneva] Conventions or of this Protocol was committed by a subordinate does not absolve his superiors from penal or disciplinary responsibility, as the case may be, if they knew, or had information which should have enabled them to conclude in the circumstances at the time, that he was committing or was going to commit such a breach and if they did not take all feasible measures within their power to prevent or repress the breach.”
</div>
</div>
<p>
Superior orders cannot be invoked as a defence for violations of international humanitarian law, but they may be taken into account in mitigation of punishment. This principle has been recognized since the Nuremberg trials after World War II and is now part of customary international law.
