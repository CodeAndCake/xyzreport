				<p>The week commencing 12 April 2015 saw what is believed to be the largest loss of life at sea in the recent history of the Mediterranean. On 12 April, 400 people died when an overcrowded boat capsized due to its passengers&rsquo; excitement at the sight of tugboats approaching to rescue them. Less than a week later, on 18 April, a similar incident took an even greater toll in human lives, leading the deadliest single shipwreck recorded by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the Mediterranean.

        Over 800 people are believed to have died when a migrants&rsquo; vessel sank after colliding with a cargo ship that had approached to carry out a rescue operation due to a mis-manoeuvre. More than 1200 lives were thus lost in a single week. As M&eacute;decins sans frontieres (MSF) commented at the time, these figures eerily resemble those of a war zone.

				<p>Beyond their huge death toll, what is most striking about these events is that they were not the result of the reluctance to carry out rescue operations, which has been identified as a structural cause of migrants&rsquo; deaths in the Mediterranean Sea and which we have documented in previous reports.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>

        In these two cases, the actual loss of life occurred <em>during</em> and partly <em>through</em> the rescue operation itself. The detailed reconstruction of these two successive tragedies provided in this report in the &ldquo;Black Week&rdquo; section shows, however, that in all likelihood the merchant vessels involved complied with their legal obligations and did everything they possibly could to rescue the passengers in distress. While it could appear that only the ruthless smugglers who overcrowded unseaworthy boats to the point of collapse are to blame, the report focuses on the deeper responsibilities of EU agencies and policy makers. It demonstrates that the latter&rsquo;s policy of retreat from state-led Search and Rescue (SAR) operations shifted the burden of extremely dangerous search and rescue operations onto large merchant ships, which are ill-fitted to conduct them. In this way, EU agencies and policy makers knowingly created the conditions that led to massive loss of life in the April shipwrecks.</p>

					<h3><span class="h3-heading">About the report</span></h3>
				</div>

				<p>The following report, produced by Forensic Oceanography &ndash; a research team based within the Forensic Architecture agency at Goldsmiths (University of London) that specialises in the use forensic techniques and cartography to reconstruct cases of deaths at sea &ndash; in collaboration with WatchTheMed and in the framework of the ESRC-supported &ldquo;Precarious Trajectories&rdquo; research project, seeks to understand the conditions that made these events possible.</p>

				<p>It does so by mobilising a vast array of methodologies and techniques. First, the report offers, through a series of visualizations, diagrams and figures, a detailed spatio-temporal reconstruction of various cases of shipwrecks. This work was an exercise in the culling of disparate data that was eventually recombined in an effort to assemble a coherent spatial narrative of the chain of events. The reconstructions provided by the report are in fact based on numerous sources, in particular survivors&rsquo; testimonies, distress signals, Search and Rescue (SAR) reports provided by Frontex, Automatic Information System (AIS) vessel tracking data, judicial documents obtained from public prosecutors&rsquo; offices in Sicily investigating these cases, and photographs taken during the events by rescue teams. At times, elements of information were also extracted from secondary sources such as news reports and human rights reports by international organizations such as Amnesty International.</p>

				<p>The policy decisions that led to these shipwrecks, however, sought precisely to keep state-operated assets at a distance from the area in which these were occurring. Focusing exclusively on the reconstruction of the events, then, would not have allowed for an accurate description of the mechanisms of this form of killing by omission. Therefore, in addition to case reconstruction, the report undertook an analysis that could be characterized as a &ldquo;policy forensics&rdquo;. This consisted of a comprehensive textual analysis of various technical assessments produced by Frontex, official statements by policy makers and EU officials, minutes of operational meetings between Frontex and other member states agencies, and transcripts of debates in the European Parliament and in its Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) committee. This endeavour was necessary, first of all, in order to gain a fine-grained understanding of the successive institutional steps that led to the retreat of state-led SAR operations. Secondly, it has allowed us to assess with precision the degree of knowledge concerning the risks to migrants&rsquo; lives the actors taking these decisions possessed. On this basis, the report points to the responsibility of the various agencies and individuals that took those decisions.</p>

				<p>Finally, the report seeks to attend to the materialisation of these policies at sea, in terms of: the operational zones, operational logics and practices of state actors; how these policy shifts affected the practices of other actors operating at sea, such as smugglers and merchant ships; and the conditions and danger of migrants&rsquo; crossings. Here key sources were: spatial analysis of operational zones; interviews with state officials (the Italian Coast Guard, Customs Police and Frontex) concerning their operations at sea; and statistical data referring to migrant arrivals, deaths and SAR operations.</p>

				<p>The diversity of sources and types of data required the report to draw upon the methodologies and expertise of a variety of disciplines. The material has thus been analysed in collaboration with experts in the relevant fields of geographic information science, vessel tracking technologies, image forensics, oceanography, statistical analysis, EU policy, international law and migration studies.</p>

					<h3><span class="h3-heading">Report outline</span></h3>
				</div>

				<p>In the first section, entitled &ldquo;Ending Mare Nostrum&rdquo;, by dissecting minutes of political meetings and previously unreleased operational documents, the report reconstructs the institutional process that unfolded after the announcement of the Italian government&rsquo;s intention to discontinue the military-humanitarian operation Mare Nostrum (MN). The latter, which began in October 2013, had deployed unprecedented means to rescue migrants in distress close to the Libyan shores, but in the summer of 2014 had attracted increasing criticism for allegedly constituting a pull factor and causing more deaths at sea. The report counters these claims by demonstrating that both increased crossings and deaths had begun before the commencement of MN, and thus seeks to explain these processes by attending to a broader range of regional and political factors.</p>
				
				<p>We then reconstruct the institutional processes and the operational decision-making that led from Italy&rsquo;s announcement that it would seek the EU&rsquo;s taking over of the responsibilities of MN to the launch, on 1 November 2014, of the Triton operation. The latter, led by Frontex, the European border agency, deployed more limited assets in an area further away from the Libyan coast and did not have rescue as their operational priority. Through operational documents and meeting minutes, the report demonstrates that EU member states, political bodies and agencies &ndash; in particular Frontex &ndash; knew that the ending of MN would cause increased risk for migrants and ultimately lead to more deaths at sea, but discarded this information to prioritize the aim of deterrence.</p>
				
				<p>In the second section, &ldquo;After Mare Nostrum: January to March 2015&rdquo;, the report analyses the effects these policy decisions had on the practices of actors at sea and the danger of crossing. It does so through forensic case reconstruction, together with spatial and statistical analysis. As the reports demonstrates, the positioning of Frontex assets far away from Libyan coasts and their exclusive focus on border control left an increasingly dangerous gap in SAR capabilities. While this retreat was vocally defended by Frontex Director of Operations Division, Klaus R&ouml;sler, in a letter to the Italian authorities that we have now accessed, its deadly effects became apparent in the first months of 2015 through a series of incidents that are analysed in detail.</p>
				
				<p>These incidents show how an increasing number of migrants were left to drift for several hours or even days before being detected and before rescue means, now located much further away from the area where most SAR events were happening, managed to reach them. Moreover, the report also shows how the Italian Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centre (MRCC) in charge of SAR operations in the Sicily Channel sought to fill this SAR vacuum by increasingly calling upon merchant ships transiting in the area to carry out rescue operations. However, merchant ships are unfit to carry out the large-scale and particularly dangerous rescue operations involving migrants, as was clearly indicated by the shipwreck of 3 March 2015, in which 30 migrants lost their lives when their boat overturned in the excitement that followed the sighting of the supply vessel that was approaching to rescue them. These signals that indicated that continued crossings and increasing deaths were materialising were not heeded to.</p>
				
				<p>In the third section, &ldquo;April&rsquo;s Black Week&rdquo;, the report reconstructs in detail the 12 and 18 April 2015 shipwrecks in which more than 1200 people died. While it could appear then that only the ruthless smugglers who overcrowded unseaworthy boats to the point of collapse are to blame, in light of the sequence of events and policy decisions we have reconstructed, we can see another level of political responsibility emerging. The EU&rsquo;s policy of retreat of state-operated rescue at sea left in fact ill-adapted commercial vessels to bear most of the responsibility for rescuing and this, in turn, led to <em>assistance becoming deadly.</em> Death by rescue was thus the outcome of the EU&rsquo;s policies of non-assistance. Relying on statistical analysis, we further show that the predictions of human rights organisations turned out to be true: ending Mare Nostrum did not lead to less crossings, only to more deaths at sea and a higher mortality rate.</p>
				
				<p>In the fourth section, &ldquo;After the April Shipwrecks&rdquo;, we show the EU was forced to re-extend its operations at sea to respond to public outcry these shipwrecks caused. This section describes the main policy shifts, most notably, the extension of Triton operational area as well as the launch of the military operation EUNAVFOR MED, both of which continued to prioritize security concerns over saving lives. Thanks also to the intervention of a veritable civilian rescue flotilla launched and the sharp decrease in the mobilisation of commercial vessels for the purpose of rescue, the mortality rate returned to the levels registered during MN. The section ends by stressing that the only factor that managed to bring the mortality rate down significantly was the opening of the so-called &ldquo;Balkan route&rdquo;, which allowed more and more migrants to change their route as of May 2015 from the central to the eastern Mediterranean, that is from a longer and much more dangerous route to a much shorter and relatively safer stretch of sea.</p>
				
				<p>Finally, in the &ldquo;Conclusions and Recommendations&rdquo;, the report summarises its findings concerning the responsibilities involved in the twin April shipwrecks. We further argue that while the current exclusionary migration regime stands, continuing to force migrants to resort to smugglers in order to to reach EU territory, proactive state-led SAR operations are necessary. However, because even in the presence of the record means deployed by the Mare Nostrum operation, the danger of crossing remained high, this are sufficient to bring the deaths of migrants to an end. Only a fundamental reorientation from a policy that seeks to select and block migrants&rsquo; movements to one that would grant legal and safe passage, thereby making both smugglers and the very need to rescue migrants at sea obsolete, would stop the list of more than 20,000 recorded cases of deaths at sea since the beginning of the 1990 from growing ever longer.</p>
